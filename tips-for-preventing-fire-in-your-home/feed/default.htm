		<description><![CDATA[Work was done timely and done well.  After trying for three years to repair my leaky chimney and not being successful, Ashbusters fixed it in a half day.  Certainly a lot of peace of mind knowing that I don&#039;t have to worry about the chimney dripping anymore during a hard rain.  We had a very hard rain last weekend, and there was not a drop of leakage.  Thanks!]]></description>
