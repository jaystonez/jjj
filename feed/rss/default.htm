				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Before you light your first fire of the season,it is recommended by national fire safety organizations like The Chimney Safety Institute of America (CSIA) and The National Fire Prevention Association (NFPA) that you should schedule your annual chimney sweeping and inspection. Our CSIA-certified chimney technicians at Ashbusters agree. In Middle Tennessee, we are fortunate to have warm early fall temperatures; however, we never know when a cold snap may surprise us. By preparing your fireplace and chimney for winter before the fall season gets underway, you will be a step ahead and will not have to wait for weeks for a chimney sweep and inspection appointment. Getting your fireplace and chimney ready to use for the cold months of the year is smart chimney maintenance, and we would like to answer some of your questions about the winter preparation of a chimney.</p>
<p><a href="file:///N:/Users/PZ/Documents/My Web Sites/Brandoo WordPress (MS SQL or Azure SQL)/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/yearly-chimney-maintenance-nashville-tn-ashbusters.jpg" class="highslide" onclick="return hs.expand(this)" ><img class="size-medium wp-image-3566 alignright" src="file:///N:/Users/PZ/Documents/My Web Sites/Brandoo WordPress (MS SQL or Azure SQL)/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/yearly-chimney-maintenance-nashville-tn-ashbusters-216x325.jpg" alt="Yearly Chimney Maintenance - Nashville TN - Ashbusters" width="216" height="325" /></a></p>
<h3>Why Is It So Important to Get My Chimney Cleaned and Inspected Before Fall?</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.cleveland.com/insideout/index.ssf/2009/10/chimney_fireplace_should_be_ch.html" target="_blank">According to the article</a>, “Chimney, Fireplace Should Be Checked Before Winter Sets In,” from the <em>Cleveland Plain Dealer</em>, statistics back up the importance of having your annual chimney cleaning and inspecting done before you begin using your fireplace for the winter. 24,500 residential fires originating from the chimney and fireplace occurred in the year 2005, as cited by the US Consumer Product Safety Commission. These fires claimed the lives of 20 people and damaged about $126 million worth of property. A professional chimney sweeping will be sure your chimney is free from fire hazards.</p>
<h3>What Is the Greatest Fire Hazard of a Dirty Chimney?</h3>
<p>The main culprit behind chimney fires is creosote building up on your chimney walls. Highly flammable deposits, creosote is the natural result of the condensation that occurs when the by-products of combustion like smoke, gases, and vapors exit the cooler upper chimney walls. Creosote eventually turns into a baked-on glaze inside your chimney, which, if the temperatures reach a high enough point, will ignite the chimney liner and the walls. Ashbusters has years of experience is cleaning the glazed creosote from chimneys and making the chimneys safe to use throughout the winter months.</p>
<h3>What Else Does Ashbusters Do to Prepare My Chimney for Winter?</h3>
<p>When we perform our chimney sweeping and inspection, we also:</p>
<ul>
<li>examine the exterior of your chimney on the roof to check the chimney cap, the flashing, and the masonry work to be sure there are no signs of damaging water penetration</li>
<li>ensure your damper opens and closes properly</li>
<li>make sure there is a clearance of at least 18 inches from your fireplace to anything that could be combustible, such as furniture and curtains</li>
<li>inspect the chimney liner for cracks and other damage</li>
<li>protect your safety by being sure there is some sort of screen in front of your fireplace</li>
<li>advise you on proper ash removal.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have not scheduled your annual chimney sweeping and inspection yet, <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/contact-us/">contact us</a> today. We will arrange an appointment for our CSIA-certified technicians to prepare your chimney for winter.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The threat of carbon monoxide poisoning can happen in your home. A scary thought? Neglecting regular chimney maintenance can result in carbon monoxide leaking into your home without you even realize it. Odorless, tasteless, and invisible, this toxic gas can even become trapped within your house. If you do not have a carbon monoxide alarm installed to alert you, you and your family could fall prey to illness or death from continuously inhaling large amounts of this gas. To be even safer from the dangers of carbon monoxide poisoning, an annual chimney sweeping and inspection from a Chimney Safety Institute of America (CSIA)-certified company like Ashbusters can stop this gas from becoming a problem. We would like to inform you about these dangers so that you can protect yourself and your family.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/carbon-monoxide-dangers-nashville-tn-ashbusters.jpg" class="highslide" onclick="return hs.expand(this)"  title="Carbon Monoxide - Nashville TN - Ashbusters"><img class="alignright wp-image-3478 size-medium" title="Carbon Monoxide - Nashville TN - Ashbusters" src="http://www.ashbusters.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/carbon-monoxide-dangers-nashville-tn-ashbusters-297x350.jpg" alt="Carbon Monoxide - Nashville TN - Ashbusters" width="297" height="350" /></a></p>
<h3>How Does Carbon Monoxide Affect My Body?</h3>
<p>When you breathe in carbon monoxide, the poisonous gas enters your bloodstream. What your blood naturally does with this gas is the true danger. Hemoglobin, a protein in your blood, chooses to pick up and carry the carbon monoxide and to ignore oxygen. Of course, we need oxygen flowing through our bloodstreams to keep our cells from suffocating. The amount of damage caused depends on how long and how intensely you are exposed to inhaling carbon monoxide.</p>
<h3>How Common Are Deaths and Illnesses Due to Carbon Monoxide Poisoning?</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.csia.org/homeowner-resources/Avoiding_Carbon_Monoxide_Hazards.aspx" target="_blank">According to the CSIA</a>, at least 200 people in the U.S. are killed every year from carbon monoxide poisoning caused by venting problems in their heating systems. Approximately 10,000 cases of sickness related to carbon monoxide are recorded each year as well.</p>
<h3>What are the Side-Effects and Symptoms of Carbon Monoxide Poisoning?</h3>
<p>Side-effects of low-level exposure can include permanent brain and other organ damage. Unfortunately, the symptoms of low-level poisoning are much like those of the common cold: headache, dizziness, fatigue, and nausea. This causes many misdiagnoses of carbon monoxide poisoning, which prolongs the exposure. If these symptoms do not go away, be persistent with your doctor and ask for a blood test to check for levels of this toxic gas. The sooner high levels are found, the sooner life-saving treatment can begin.</p>
<h3>How Does This Gas Enter My House?</h3>
<p>Poor ventilation is the primary cause of carbon monoxide coming into your home; however, the factors behind the venting problems include a damaged or missing chimney flue liner, large deposits of creosote, debris clogging the passageway, and nesting from birds or other animals blocking the flue.</p>
<h3>How Can I Stop Carbon Monoxide from Entering My Home?</h3>
<p>All of the factors behind chimney ventilation problems can be corrected with an annual chimney sweeping and inspection from Ashbusters. With cases of carbon monoxide-related health issues on the rise, our CSIA-certified chimney sweeps will clean out any blockages, check flue liners for damaging cracks, and replace a deteriorated chimney liner to protect you from the dangers of carbon monoxide poisoning.</p>
<p>If you have not scheduled your annual chimney sweeping and inspection this year, contact Ashbusters today. Our staff will arrange a chimney sweep visit to your home as soon as possible.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Want to convert an old wood-burning fireplace to a more convenient and attractive gas-operated one? Gas inserts can be the perfect solution to modernize your old hearth. At Ashbusters, we carry many styles of <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/catalog/fireplaces-and-stoves/gas-inserts/">gas inserts</a> to suit both traditional and contemporary decors. To help you learn more about these fireplace makeovers, we would like to tell you more about the advantages of installing these inserts. According to <a href="http://www.houselogic.com/home-advice/fireplaces-chimneys/gas-fireplace-inserts-pros-cons/" target="_blank">HouseLogic</a>, a home-improvement website sponsored by the National Association of Realtors, the benefits of gas inserts can provide the “ultimate in convenience.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/gas-insert-nashville-tn-ashbusters.jpg" class="highslide" onclick="return hs.expand(this)"  title="Gas Inserts - Nashville TN - Ashbusters Chimney Service"><img class="alignright wp-image-3469 size-medium" title="Gas Inserts - Nashville TN - Ashbusters Chimney Service" src="http://www.ashbusters.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/gas-insert-nashville-tn-ashbusters-300x197.jpg" alt="Gas Inserts - Nashville TN - Ashbusters Chimney Service" width="300" height="197" /></a></p>
<h3>Advantages of Gas Fireplace Inserts</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>less hassle - </strong>Imagine being able to start your fire with the push of a remote control button; you can with a gas fireplace. You will not have to deal with the chore of bringing in heavy firewood; nor will you have the cleaning involved with a wood-burning fireplace.</li>
<li><strong>lower cost -</strong> Installing an insert is much less expensive than rebuilding a new fireplace. You will also save money on your heating bills as gas heat is more energy-efficient.</li>
<li><strong>more environmentally-friendly - </strong>If you worry about the pollution caused by burning wood, a gas insert can alleviate that concern. Gas burns cleaner air &#8212; inside and outside your home. You are also saving energy since the efficiency levels of gas fireplaces are much higher than a standard wood-burning fireplace.</li>
<li><strong>easier remodel - </strong>When you want to update the look of your fireplace or even to convert to gas from wood fuel, gas inserts make changing your hearth’s decor and fuel source a simple task. Able to fit into a masonry fireplace or a pre-fabricated fireplace, inserts are then vented through your existing chimney. With the different sizes and styles of gas inserts, you are certain to find your perfect new fireplace look.</li>
<li><strong>fewer creosote worries - </strong>Since gas-burning does not create as much creosote as burning wood, you will have less maintenance. You will still need to have your chimney cleaned annually by a Chimney Institute of America-certified chimney sweep, like our chimney technicians at Ashbusters; however, you will not have to worry about scheduling multiple cleanings throughout the year to rid your chimney walls of large deposits of creosote.</li>
<li><strong>zone heating -</strong> A gas fireplace insert can heat a living space between 1,000 to 3,000 square feet, depending on the size of the insert. You are guaranteed comfortable warmth in the room where your fireplace is located, and you can turn down the thermostat in the rest of the house, which saves you money on heating bills.</li>
<li><strong>choice of vented or ventless -</strong> While a vented gas insert is the safest choice because they exhaust all of the smoke and gases through your chimney, you cannot install a vented gas fireplace insert without an existing place to vent the gas. Ventless inserts can be installed anywhere you would like a fireplace to be; however, some states have banned this type of gas-fueled appliance because the smoke and gases remain inside your home. Fortunately, many ventless inserts are now equipped with an oxygen-depletion sensor that shut them down before carbon monoxide reaches dangerous levels.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you would like to know more about the benefits of gas inserts, contact Ashbusters today. Our experienced staff can help you with any questions you may have.</p>

<p>Failing to prepare your fireplace and chimney for the conditions to which they will be subjected is surely preparing them to fail under said conditions.  If chimney maintenance isn’t at or near the top of your to do list, it should be!</p>
<p>We really put our chimney systems through the wringer during the heating season; we owe it to them to have a thorough, annual <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/services/inspections/">inspection</a> conducted after periods of heavy use so as to provide additional peace of mind that all things are as they should be.  We encourage you to use the information provided herein and pass it along to your neighbors, friends and family.</p>
<p><strong>Water is the enemy!</strong></p>
<p>Not waterproofing a chimney opens the door to a multitude of problems.  On the other hand, making the choice to waterproof your chimney enables it to repel up to 99.9% of water that could otherwise penetrate and harm all of your chimney system’s components.</p>
<p>The materials used to build most masonry chimneys experience hastened deterioration as a result of prolonged exposure to and contact with water.  The freezing and thawing process — during which time water that has penetrated the various chimney materials freezes and expands — quickly deteriorates the overall construction of your chimney.  Water in your chimney can also cause rust on steel and cast iron parts, ultimately weakening or destroying them.</p>
<p>Your chimney’s exterior is constantly battered by the weather.  Harsh weather conditions can have a negative effect on your chimney.  In addition, when water mixes with the creosote that is often present in a wood-burning fireplace, it will generate an extremely unpleasant odor that can fill your entire home.  All of these things combined greatly compromise the overall structure of your chimney.</p>
<p><strong>Chimney sweeping is a must!</strong></p>
<p>Basking in the warmth of a roaring fire during the colder months is like a rite of passage for many.  Winter isn’t complete unless there’s a fire burning in the fireplace.  Much preparation goes into making this a reality.  If you don’t put some thought into it before you light your winter fires, your enjoyment could very well be short-lived.</p>
<p>Dirty chimneys can cause chimney fires, which damage structures, destroy homes and injure or kill people; it can also lead to carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning which can harm or kill people as well.  Creosote becomes dangerous when it’s allowed to accumulate in your chimney.  Although the buildup cannot be avoided completely, burning small, hot fires and using dry, seasoned wood can minimize the buildup.</p>
<p>Sooner or later, every chimney needs to be cleaned to remove creosote buildup.  It’s highly recommended that you leave this task to a CSIA-certified chimney sweep.  The frequency for your cleanings will vary based on the amount of use your fireplace receives, but it should never be any longer than a year between cleanings, as the likelihood of a clean chimney catching fire or producing deadly levels of CO is far less than a dirty one.</p>
<p>When you go too long without keeping up with those critical items on your honey do list, you can find yourself creating bigger home repair expenses for yourself.  As many homeowners can attest, small problems can become big problems when routine maintenance is neglected.</p>
<p>The best way to maintain a fully functioning and safe chimney system is to hire CSIA-certified chimney pros like Ashbusters to ensure your maintenance is done right the first time, every time.  We know we’re not the only chimney service in town; however, we believe we are the best and would greatly appreciate it if you would give us the opportunity to prove it!</p>

The same holds true for your chimney masonry. Spalling is one thing that can happen to it.</p></div>
<h3>What Is Spalling?</h3>
<p>All kinds of crazy things can happen to your chimney masonry. One look at our <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/services/chimney-repairs/chimneys-gone-wild/" target="_blank">Chimneys Gone Wild</a> page [link to ] will show you that.</p>
<p>One of the problems that Ashbusters sees most often with chimney brick in Nashville is something called “spalling.” Spalling can afflict just about any sort of stone surface; patios, walkways, and pool decks are also prone to spalling. Spalling bricks may be found both on both the inside and outside of your chimney. Only a professional chimney inspection will reveal whether or not the brick inside your chimney is in good shape. In fact, we would only recommend hiring a chimney technician—rather than a brick mason—to repair your chimney brick, as chimneys face specific problems and serve purposes that only a C.S.I.A. [www.csia.org] trained sweep will be able to properly address.</p>
<h3>How can I tell if my chimney is spalling?</h3>
<p>You will be able to identify a spalling problem if it looks like the face of your chimney brick, even a small portion of it, has popped off or is flaking off.</p>
<h3>Why is my chimney spalling?</h3>
<p>This is brick’s natural response to water intrusion and to the freeze/thaw cycle. Brick and mortar can unfortunately be quite porous if not protected, and water damage will only grow worse over time. The good news though is that there are plenty of ways to safeguard brick from this kind of damage in the future.</p>
<h3>Can you fix my spalling brick?</h3>
<p>Absolutely. Ashbusters handles a wide variety of <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/services/chimney-repairs/chimney-masonry/" target="_blank">masonry repairs</a>. In most cases, if we find that the interior of your chimney is spalling or cracking, we will recommend that you reline it or use a chimney resurfacing system that will fill in any gaps, making your chimney safe for use again. If your exterior brick is spalling, we will replace the damaged bricks and mortar. We can also tuckpoint to fill in any mortar gaps.</p>
<h3>Can you protect my brick so it doesn’t spall again?</h3>
<p>Yes, we highly recommend a service called chimney waterproofing. It is a good idea to waterproof your chimney after you have had spalling problems or other masonry repairs taken care of; this will seal your repair work for the next decade at least.</p>
<p>Do you have a chimney in need of repair? Call Ashbusters today!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you’re new to fireplace or stove ownership, there are a few key things that you’ll need to learn straight away. One of those things: proper burning practices, like using only seasoned or kiln-dried firewood in your<a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/catalog/fireplaces-and-stoves/wood-fireplaces/" target="_blank"> wood-burning appliance</a>, and making sure your damper is completely open before you start a fire. Another: the need for regular maintenance — including annual chimney inspection  and chimney sweeping  appointments — to keep your system running efficiently and effectively. And along with those basics, you’ll want to know why you’re doing all that.</p>
<p>The answer to the latter, in a lot of cases, is creosote. If you’re not familiar with creosote, using a hearth appliance quickly makes you become familiar with it — it’s a constant part of using a wood-burning appliance. Want to know more? Here’s a quick creosote F.A.Q.</p>
<p><strong>How Do I Know If There’s Creosote In My Chimney?</strong></p>
<div id="attachment_3315" style="width: 299px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Creosote-F.A.Q.-Nashville-TN-Ashbusters.jpg" class="highslide" onclick="return hs.expand(this)" ><img class="size-medium wp-image-3315" src="http://www.ashbusters.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Creosote-F.A.Q.-Nashville-TN-Ashbusters-289x300.jpg" alt="Ignoring annual chimney cleanings and inspections can be dangerous to your home and your family. Let us help you minimize your risks. " width="289" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Ignoring annual chimney cleanings and inspections can be dangerous to your home and your family. Let us help you minimize your risks.</p></div>
<p>Unlike some other byproducts of combustion — like colorless and odorless carbon monoxide — creosote makes itself known. You may smell a smoky odor coming from your chimney that indicates creosote’s presence, or you might see creosote deposits around your flue opening. Depending on the level of creosote you have (levels 1, 2 an 3 are how hearth professionals categorize the progression of creosote residue), it might look powdery and velvety, crunchy and flaky, thick and drippy or hard and shiny, in colors ranging from brown to black.</p>
<p>But really, here’s the underlying truth about whether or not there’s creosote in your chimney: If you’ve been burning wood in your fireplace or stove, there’s creosote in your chimney. Its development is a natural part of burning wood. The combustion of wood creates a mix of byproducts — including smoke, small particles, tar fog and gases — that rise up the chimney and meet the cooler flue walls, condensing into a liquid. That liquid residue is creosote, and it layers and thickens over time and with use of your appliance.</p>
<p><strong>Can I Stop Creosote From Forming?</strong></p>
<p>You can’t prevent creosote development, but you can use some smart burning practices to limit its build-up. They include the ones we mentioned above — using properly dried wood, and opening your damper completely. Those practices help you develop a fire that’s burning hot enough to encourage proper draft and effective venting.</p>
<p><strong>If Creosote Is So Common, Why Do I Need To Be Concerned About It?</strong></p>
<p>Excessive creosote brings a grab bag of problems along with it. First, there’s the fact that creosote is highly combustible — so the more creosote is lining your flue, the higher the chances of a fire hazard become.</p>
<p>Creosote can also affect your chimney’s ability to vent effectively — if it thickens considerably on your flue walls, it can minimize your chimney’s draft, or even block your flue.</p>
<p><strong>How Do I Get Rid Of Creosote?</strong></p>
<p>On your end, all you need to do to ensure proper creosote removal is to give Ashbusters Chimney Service a call and schedule a <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/services/sweeping/" target="_blank">chimney sweeping  appointment</a>. Our CSIA-certified sweeps use specially designed brushes and tools and a vacuum system with a triple layer HEPA filter to make sure that your flue walls are free of creosote, and your home is free of dust. When professional chimney sweeping is done annually, you can expect your chimney to vent better, longer — and you can rest easy knowing that you’re not leaving a potential fire hazard uncorrected.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about creosote — or want to schedule a chimney sweeping appointment — give Ashbusters a call. We’d love to help you enjoy a clean and well-performing chimney!</p>

Be aware of the common causes of a leaky chimney so you can help prevent it.</p></div>
<p>Unfortunately, when you have a masonry chimney, sooner or later, it is going to leak. According to the <a href="http://www.csia.org/homeowner-resources/water_and_your_masonry_chimney.aspx" target="_blank">Chimney Safety Institute of America</a> (CSIA), water is your masonry chimney’s biggest enemy. This is due in large part to the fact that the outer part of your chimney is exposed to rain, moisture and the elements, which leads to water penetrating the porous brickwork and mortar of your chimney. This water penetration causes extensive and expensive damage, ranging from rusted fireplace and chimney parts to rotted wood and stained walls and ceilings; extreme cases can even result in moderate to severe chimney structural damage.</p>
<p>You believe you have protected your chimney from water penetration and cannot seem to figure out what is causing your chimney to leak? The CSIA-certified chimney technicians at Ashbusters are experienced at finding the point of origin of chimney<a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/services/chimney-repairs/chimney-leaks/" target="_blank"> leaks</a>, determining what is causing the leak, and repairing the leak, along with any damage it has caused to your chimney and fireplace.</p>
<p>As chimney leaks are difficult to pinpoint, it is helpful to know their main causes. To give you a better idea of where you should focus your attention, the home improvement website, Improvenet by CraftJack, provides the following common sources of chimney leaks:</p>
<h3>1. The Mortar Crown or Chimney Cap</h3>
<p>If the mortar around the top of your chimney begins to crack and crumble, or if you have a damaged chimney cap with cracks and chips, rainwater is leaking into your chimney from the very top. Since both bricks and mortar are porous, water can be absorbed into your chimney walls and leads to gradual deterioration from within. The solution to this problem is simple, and Ashbusters can help you in selecting and installing a new <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/catalog/chimney-caps/" target="_blank">chimney cap</a> or creating and installing a customized <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/services/chimney-repairs/chimney-masonry/" target="_blank">masonry</a> chimney crown and repairing the damaged bricks and mortar around it.</p>
<h3>2. Deteriorating Mortar Joints</h3>
<p>When mortar joints age and erode, holes develop, and water has another passageway through which to enter the chimney. The amount and size of these holes can and will vary and can become large enough to allow a sizable amount of water in during a heavy rain. Even if the hole is small, water can still seep into the joint, travel to a hole in the brick, and maneuver its way down the chimney. Ashbusters can save the day with our years of masonry and solve this problem by repointing the deteriorated mortar joints with new mortar.</p>
<h3>3. Flashing</h3>
<p>Your flashing, the metal sheeting that protects the area where your chimney meets your roof, is a common place for water to penetrate your chimney. Even if it looks like it is securely covering the area around your chimney, it only takes one tiny hole for water to enter the chimney. The best solution to this problem is to have your flashing professionally re-fitted and installed. We at Ashbusters are experienced with building complete <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/services/chimney-repairs/chimney-masonry/" target="_blank">masonry chimneys</a>, so our CSIA-certified technicians can take care of this flashing job for you.</p>
<h3>4. The Roof Shingles Around the Chimney</h3>
<p>This is the least common cause for a chimney leak, but if the experts at Ashbusters cannot find the leak in the other 3 areas or anywhere else, you more than likely have damaged and/or loose roof shingles. To solve this problem, you will need to call a roofing expert to diagnose this problem and repair it by replacing the shingles.</p>
<p>If you suspect you have a leaky chimney, do not hesitate to <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/contact-us/" target="_blank">contact</a> Ashbusters today. We will find the leak and repair your problem quickly.</p>

<p>Having a chimney in your home is more than just having cozy warm nights with a rustic ambiance. It also entails a lot of responsibility and keen observational skills on your end, especially if you want to ensure your chimney’s functionality as well as your family’s safety.</p>
<p>More often than not, our team at <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/" target="_blank">Ashbusters Chimney Service</a> get approached by homeowners presenting concerns or asking certain things and issues about their chimneys. One of the most asked questions is regarding their chimney draft.</p>
<p><strong><em>So, here’s a short reference that has everything you would need to know about chimney drafts:</em></strong></p>
<h3>What is a chimney draft?</h3>
<p>The chimney draft, or simply called the draft, is the pulling action in your chimney caused by the negative pressure mechanism that’s at play inside each and every one of your chimneys. You see, your chimney produces hot air. When the heat generated inside the chimney reaches a certain level, it starts to pull air through the firebox, and thus, the draft.</p>
<h3>How will you be able to identify a draft problem?</h3>
<p>This is relatively easy to spot. All you need to watch out for are the 3 cardinal signs that are indicative of a chimney draft problem. First, you need to observe the air inside your home. If air begins to enter your home from your chimney, then that’s a sign that something is definitely wrong. Second, when you have unusual trying to start a fire or keep it burning, that’s another sign. And lastly, if you notice a smokey smell around your house even without a fire burning, then that’s definitely a warning sign.</p>
<h3>How does it affect us?</h3>
<p>Initially or in minute cases, draft problems don’t really pose that much of a threat to us. But according to the C<a href="http://www.csia.org/" target="_blank">himney Safety Institute of America</a>, in worst case scenarios it may turn your home into a risky living environment by becoming a fire and health hazard. Carbon monoxide poisoning can easily occur due to improper draft.</p>
<h3>What can we do?</h3>
<p>The best and smartest thing to do is to contact a <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/contact-us/" target="_blank">chimney expert</a> to check your chimney as soon as possible. Not only will they be able to point out damages and risks, but they would also help you in setting up preventive measure as to avoid dreadful and horrible scenarios from ever occurring.</p>
<p>Chimney draft problems are more common than you think. For all you know you have one going on in your home at this very moment. So what are you waiting for? Pick up the phone or open your computers and set an appointment as soon as you can.</p>

Make sure your chimney is always clean.</p></div>
<p>If you have a chimney, chances are you have had something stuck inside it at some point. A chimney blockage can be a dangerous situation; as stated by the <a href="http://www.csia.org/homeowner-resources/the_facts_about_chimney_fires.aspx" target="_blank">Chimney Safety Institute of America</a> (CSIA), a dirty chimney can cause a chimney fire. One of the main reasons an annual <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/services/sweeping/" target="_blank">chimney sweep</a> is so important, proper maintenance of your chimney prevents your chimney from blockages as everything is cleaned out and removed in the chimney sweep process. We at Ashbusters provide the best chimney sweep in town, and our CSIA-certified technicians will remove the following common chimney blockages when they are stuck in your chimney.</p>
<h3>Animals</h3>
<p>When the cold weather comes, animals like birds, squirrels, and raccoons come looking for a warm place to nest for the winter, and your chimney may become a chosen home. This can create a very perilous situation as not only could it cause a dangerous fire if you light a fire while the animal is inside your chimney, but if the animal becomes stuck, it could die, leaving it to spread foul, putrid fumes through your house. You should never try to remove a wild animal from a chimney yourself. Always call professionals like Ashbusters. We are <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/services/sweeping/" target="_blank">qualified</a> with removing animal debris, and if need be, we can contact a professional animal remover if an animal is still alive.</p>
<h3>Debris</h3>
<p>Even though you may have a chimney cap, leaves, trash, and settlement still seem to get into your chimney and accumulate. After a period of time, this accumulation can cause a blockage large enough to cause incomplete combustion and negative air pressure, driving smoke back into your house. Also, if you allow settlement to build up long enough, it causes cracks in your flue, and then you will have dangerous, poisonous carbon monoxide leaking into your house.</p>
<h3>Creosote</h3>
<p>If you have a wood-burning stove, you have creosote deposits building up on the walls of your chimney, and if you go too long without a chimney sweeping, creosote can build up large enough to be a hazardous blockage. According to the <a href="http://www.csia.org/homeowner-resources/the_facts_about_chimney_fires.aspx" target="_blank">CSIA</a>, creosote is formed naturally in the wood-burning process. When the by-products of combustion (smoke, vapors, tar fog, gases, hyrdocarbon, unburned wood particles, etc) exit your fireplace and go out your cooler chimney, condensation occurs, and the result is creosote residue. Black or brown in appearance, creosote can be sticky and tar-like, shiny and hardened, or crusty and flaky, but no matter what it looks like, it is a dangerous, highly-combustible compound that is the leading cause of chimney fires. Luckily, your annual <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/services/sweeping/" target="_blank">chimney sweep</a> will take care of all of the creosote build-up in your chimney. The CSIA-certified chimney sweeps at Ashbusters are highly trained to remove all creosote deposits from your chimney, making it safe from chimney fires.</p>
<p>Although, the “something is stuck in my chimney!” situation sounds dire and can be an emergency, there is a simple solution: <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/contact-us/" target="_blank">contact</a> Ashbusters today for a professional chimney sweep to get the blockage out of your chimney and safely enjoy your fireplace again.</p>
