				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chimneys are natural sources of drafts because they are gaping holes that emit and pull in air. Anyone who owns a wood burning appliance should understand the concept of draft. Air moving up a chimney follows the same physical principles as does water flowing in a hose. Addressing chimney draft issues enables the fireplace and chimney to operate in peak condition.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2301" title="Dealing with chimney draft problems" alt="Dealing with chimney draft problems" src="http://www.ashbusters.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/ashbusters-chimney-draft-problems-300x239.jpg" width="300" height="239" /></p>
<p>When the fireplace chimney is filled with hot air, additional air is pulled through the firebox in a process called draft. A chimney is an example of a negative pressure system because air pressure is negative. Increasing the chimney draft is similar to opening a water faucet connected to a hose. By burning a fire hotter, lighter air is created, increasing the draft in the chimney through increased pull. Increasing the chimney height will also provide more draft.</p>
<p>Given the same amount of draft, a flue that is larger will exhaust more smoke from a fireplace. However, just as a water hose may become plugged, chimney airflow may be restricted by several conditions, slowing the flow of smoke up the chimney. A closed or improperly operating damper, excessive deposits of creosote, or dirty chimney cap can create poor air flow within a chimney.</p>
<p>An improperly constructed chimney or structural damage to the area can also prevent the maximum amount of smoke from being exhausted from the fireplace. In some cases, smoke may be emitted backwards, ending up in the home. This forces occupants to breathe the contained chemicals and impurities, which is a health hazard.</p>
<p>A chimney sweep can <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/services/inspections/">inspect the chimney</a> to identify whether the proper amount of draft and air flow are occurring. If creosote has built up or something is obstructing the air flow, the sweep will remove it by cleaning the chimney. Structural issues can be addressed by chimney repair or in the most severe cases, replacement.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If your restaurant has a wood-fired oven, your customers no doubt rave about the incredible taste of the menu items cooked inside of it. The look and feel of a wood-fired stove can create an atmosphere for a restaurant that is truly spectacular. However, you do need to remember that since it is a wood burning stove and not a standard oven, it will require <a href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/modern-homesteading/ask-our-experts-wood-burning-stove-creosote-buildup-zm0z11zblon.aspx" target="_blank">some extra cleaning</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/ashbusters-pizza-oven-chimney-cleaning.jpg" class="highslide" onclick="return hs.expand(this)"  title="Chimney Cleaning for a Wood-Fired Oven"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2269" title="Chimney Cleaning for a Wood-Fired Oven" alt="Chimney Cleaning for a Wood-Fired Oven" src="http://www.ashbusters.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/ashbusters-pizza-oven-chimney-cleaning-295x300.jpg" width="295" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>In many cases, these ovens are burning for as long as 12 hours a day during days of operation. Unlike most fireplaces in homes, these ovens are not getting warm nights, spring, and summer off. Instead, they are in constant use, creating much more buildup over shorter periods of time than a fireplace in the home.</p>
<p>All of this extra usage means extra cleaning. Whereas a home chimney only requires an annual cleaning, a wood-fired oven chimney may need cleaning as frequently as every six weeks. One of the main reasons for this is that in addition to burning far more often, the fuel loads used are far more significant than homeowners would use in their own fireplaces.</p>
<p>While creosote buildup is an obvious concern with so much use, so is a buildup of ash in the chimney. Together, these two can create an extremely flammable and unsafe environment for the restaurant, its staff, and the guests. Restaurant owners with wood-fired ovens are best served to have a professional and certified chimney sweep scheduled for periodic cleaning of the chimney.</p>
<p>The cleaning can be scheduled during off hours so it will not interfere with restaurant operations. Assuming there are no challenges, the entire process should take no more than a couple of hours, if that. Furthermore, by hiring a professional, you are guaranteed the area will be kept clean and will be safe to use again as soon as the work is completed.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We started Ashbusters in 1985 on the notion that there was a better way to do business. We wanted to make sure everyone loved our work, and we hoped everyone felt they had received great value for their dollar. All these years later, it feels like people have gotten the message. We serve the entire Middle Tennessee area, and this summer, we opened a <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/locations/south-carolina-locations/charleston-sc/">new location in Charleston, South Carolina</a>.</p>
<p>In Middle Tennessee, some of the areas we service include the west Nashville communities of Bellevue, Belle Meade and Green Hills. These older areas of town are known for their beautiful older homes, with some new ones mixed in. Older constructions weren&#8217;t always built with fire safety in mind. The dryer vents could stretch completely across the house, meaning you are going to need a good dryer vent cleaning to reach all the way across. This also is the case for the beautiful older homes that make up Nashville&#8217;s oldest residential community, East Nashville.</p>
<p>We have two office locations in Tennessee, one of which is in Smyrna. This wonderful little town on the outskirts of Nashville is the Middle Tennessee home to Ashbusters. We have been preaching to the community the importance of regular chimney cleanings the entire time. The best way to keep your family safe is to make sure that your chimney is clean and operational. Cracks in the mortar can put you in danger of having a house fire.</p>
<p>We also have long tried to stay active in our community. After all, you are the reason we are in business at all. We want you to know exactly how important you are to us. If you ever have any questions, please <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/contact-us/">contact us</a>. Also, if you want to read more about our <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/locations/">service locations</a>, we talk in depth about each area of town. Thanks for all the years of supporting our business, and we look forward to serving you much more in the future.</p>
