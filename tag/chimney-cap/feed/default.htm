Be aware of the common causes of a leaky chimney so you can help prevent it.</p></div>
<p>Unfortunately, when you have a masonry chimney, sooner or later, it is going to leak. According to the <a href="http://www.csia.org/homeowner-resources/water_and_your_masonry_chimney.aspx" target="_blank">Chimney Safety Institute of America</a> (CSIA), water is your masonry chimney’s biggest enemy. This is due in large part to the fact that the outer part of your chimney is exposed to rain, moisture and the elements, which leads to water penetrating the porous brickwork and mortar of your chimney. This water penetration causes extensive and expensive damage, ranging from rusted fireplace and chimney parts to rotted wood and stained walls and ceilings; extreme cases can even result in moderate to severe chimney structural damage.</p>
<p>You believe you have protected your chimney from water penetration and cannot seem to figure out what is causing your chimney to leak? The CSIA-certified chimney technicians at Ashbusters are experienced at finding the point of origin of chimney<a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/services/chimney-repairs/chimney-leaks/" target="_blank"> leaks</a>, determining what is causing the leak, and repairing the leak, along with any damage it has caused to your chimney and fireplace.</p>
<p>As chimney leaks are difficult to pinpoint, it is helpful to know their main causes. To give you a better idea of where you should focus your attention, the home improvement website, Improvenet by CraftJack, provides the following common sources of chimney leaks:</p>
<h3>1. The Mortar Crown or Chimney Cap</h3>
<p>If the mortar around the top of your chimney begins to crack and crumble, or if you have a damaged chimney cap with cracks and chips, rainwater is leaking into your chimney from the very top. Since both bricks and mortar are porous, water can be absorbed into your chimney walls and leads to gradual deterioration from within. The solution to this problem is simple, and Ashbusters can help you in selecting and installing a new <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/catalog/chimney-caps/" target="_blank">chimney cap</a> or creating and installing a customized <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/services/chimney-repairs/chimney-masonry/" target="_blank">masonry</a> chimney crown and repairing the damaged bricks and mortar around it.</p>
<h3>2. Deteriorating Mortar Joints</h3>
<p>When mortar joints age and erode, holes develop, and water has another passageway through which to enter the chimney. The amount and size of these holes can and will vary and can become large enough to allow a sizable amount of water in during a heavy rain. Even if the hole is small, water can still seep into the joint, travel to a hole in the brick, and maneuver its way down the chimney. Ashbusters can save the day with our years of masonry and solve this problem by repointing the deteriorated mortar joints with new mortar.</p>
<h3>3. Flashing</h3>
<p>Your flashing, the metal sheeting that protects the area where your chimney meets your roof, is a common place for water to penetrate your chimney. Even if it looks like it is securely covering the area around your chimney, it only takes one tiny hole for water to enter the chimney. The best solution to this problem is to have your flashing professionally re-fitted and installed. We at Ashbusters are experienced with building complete <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/services/chimney-repairs/chimney-masonry/" target="_blank">masonry chimneys</a>, so our CSIA-certified technicians can take care of this flashing job for you.</p>
<h3>4. The Roof Shingles Around the Chimney</h3>
<p>This is the least common cause for a chimney leak, but if the experts at Ashbusters cannot find the leak in the other 3 areas or anywhere else, you more than likely have damaged and/or loose roof shingles. To solve this problem, you will need to call a roofing expert to diagnose this problem and repair it by replacing the shingles.</p>
<p>If you suspect you have a leaky chimney, do not hesitate to <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/contact-us/" target="_blank">contact</a> Ashbusters today. We will find the leak and repair your problem quickly.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Waterproofing Your Chimney to Perfection</b></p>
<p>When your chimney is already undergoing extensive water damage, the costs for repair will soon match or even exceed the money you spent to get it installed in the first place. That’s why preventing this from happening is the smart thing to do for all homeowners who have fireplaces and chimneys. The best way to do this is by <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/services/chimney-repairs/chimney-leaks/" target="_blank">waterproofing your chimney</a>. Taking note of this crucial step in chimney maintenance will help prepare you and your chimney for yet another year of alternating cold, freezing temperatures and warm sunny days. This tip is especially important during the rainy season because you have to make sure that as little water as possible enters your chimney.</p>
<div id="attachment_3156" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Tax-Credit-2013-Long-Island-NY-Beach-Stove-and-Fireplace.jpg" class="highslide" onclick="return hs.expand(this)" ><img class="size-medium wp-image-3156" alt="Keeping the moisture from getting into your chimney is far easier than repairing the damage it can do. It is much less expensive too." src="http://www.ashbusters.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Tax-Credit-2013-Long-Island-NY-Beach-Stove-and-Fireplace-300x262.jpg" width="300" height="262" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Keeping the moisture from getting into your chimney is far easier than repairing the damage it can do. It is much less expensive too.</p></div>
<p>Water is one of the strongest reasons for chimney deterioration. It can seep briskly inside and occupy areas in the masonry bricks. If taken for granted, the moisture can even harbour molds that could be dangerous to the health of the occupants in the house. This will then lead to far bigger problems.</p>
<p>What we would usually recommend here at Ashbusters Chimney Service is to first do a routine inspection of your chimney. This will help our experts assess the condition of your chimney and decide on what to do from there. This can also help us see what the options are and discuss them with you so that you are well informed about the things we will do to help maintain the structure and function of your chimney. For this type of inspection, we use specialized video cameras to check the most delicate areas, especially in the nooks and crannies where water will most likely hide.</p>
<p>When all the repairs are in order, we would definitely advise you to get a chimney cap installed. This will eliminate most water from getting into the chimney through it’s main opening. The chimney cap is the defense system of the chimney, so it needs to be strong and durable to protect the inside area. Usually when the winter season arrives, the endurance of the chimney cap is challenged. Nonetheless, getting a stainless steel chimney cap will do the trick.</p>
<p>Another good way of waterproofing your chimney is to use water repellent. This is applied on the bricks of your chimney walls and other areas that are most likely to be exposed to moisture. This can help strengthen the chimney walls especially when heavy rain starts to pour. Many repellents can be effective for years to specifically strengthen the parts of the chimney that cannot be protected by the chimney cap.</p>
<p>If you feel like your chimney or fireplace needs some sprucing up, then call us at Ashbusters Chimney Service. After over twenty-five years of outstanding service to our clients in Nashville Tennessee and in surrounding towns, we can proudly guarantee a legacy of quality service and dedication. Here, you are always our priority.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/services/chimney-repairs/chimney-leaks/">leaky chimney</a> is mistaken for a leaky roof so often that even roofers recommend chimney inspections. While it can be very difficult to determine the source of a leak, the chances improve when professionals with lots of experience look for them. Homeowners willing to get up on their roofs &#8212; who can safely do so &#8212; can definitely try, however.</p>
<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2873" title="Leaky Chimney - Nashville TN - Ashbusters Chimney Service" alt="Leaky Chimney - Nashville TN - Ashbusters Chimney Service" src="http://www.ashbusters.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/ashbusters-chimney-leak-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" />
<p>By closely looking at a few things, you may be able to spot the obvious. The place to start is with the components intended to keep water out. The chimney cap and crown, and the mortar between bricks or roof and flashing, are the places to start. They exist to prevent water from entering the chimney, so if it got in, one or more of them is probably implicated.</p>
<p>Along with those, some of you will also need to check the waterproof seal applied to your chimney because nothing is impervious to water and time. Once you start to really look, a few things might jump out at you, like a missing chimney cap. It happens more often than you probably imagine, as wind, birds, and animals can all take a lightweight or poorly designed chimney cap.</p>
<p>If there is no cap on your flue and your damper is open, you may have just found the source of the “leak”, but do not stop there. Really examine the chimney crown, which is the cover for the chase around the flue. Look for cracks, crumbling, chips, stains, mold, &#8212; anything which permits water to enter or is evidence of it.</p>
<p>The crown is supposed to send water away from its own center as well as the chimney. If mold is on it, it is not doing its job right. So, even if you cannot see significant cracking in it, something is wrong. If you do see new cracks, you may have found another explanation for a leaky chimney. However, this is probably the time to <a href="http://www.csia.org/homeowner-resources/how_to_hire_a_chimney_sweep.aspx" target="_blank">call in a chimney sweep</a> to take a look and repair it properly.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Homeowners should be aware of the various safety devices available to them for their chimney. Something very commonly used is a fireplace screen or cage. This protects the family inside the home from embers leaving the fireplace as well as preventing things from being mistakenly thrown into the fireplace. But, what protects the home outside from these very same conditions?</p>
<p>A spark arrestor is <a href="http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-spark-arrestor.htm" target="_blank">very necessary piece of equipment</a> for anyone owning a fireplace. In essence, a spark arrestor is a device that is put in place that prevents flammable debris from escaping a combustion source. In this case, your fireplace. This device prevents burning embers from flying up your fireplace and out into the open area outside, where the embers could hit a tree or leaves, and start a fire.</p>
<p>You may not be familiar with the term spark arrestor, but you may <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/catalog/chimney-caps/">know this device as a chimney cap</a>. In order to be classified as a spark arrestor, the chimney cap must have some type of mesh lining, in most cases this is steel mesh, which prevents anything from getting out of or into the flue.</p>
<p>In addition to preventing the embers from leaving the fireplace, these devices serve several other purposes. The first being the prevention of water from getting down inside the flue and possibly into the fireplace when there is a fire burning. For obvious reasons, this is not something any homeowner would like to experience.</p>
<p>The second reason is in the prevention of animals, such as birds or bats, getting down inside the chimney to nest. While regular birds can be removed, a chimney swift could present not only inconvenience, but also significant fines if the bird is hurt. This particular bird is protected by law and the homeowner must wait until the birds leave the nest for the winter before they can do anything to remove it.</p>
