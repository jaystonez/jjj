<p>When you’re new to fireplace or stove ownership, there are a few key things that you’ll need to learn straight away. One of those things: proper burning practices, like using only seasoned or kiln-dried firewood in your<a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/catalog/fireplaces-and-stoves/wood-fireplaces/" target="_blank"> wood-burning appliance</a>, and making sure your damper is completely open before you start a fire. Another: the need for regular maintenance — including annual chimney inspection  and chimney sweeping  appointments — to keep your system running efficiently and effectively. And along with those basics, you’ll want to know why you’re doing all that.</p>
<p>The answer to the latter, in a lot of cases, is creosote. If you’re not familiar with creosote, using a hearth appliance quickly makes you become familiar with it — it’s a constant part of using a wood-burning appliance. Want to know more? Here’s a quick creosote F.A.Q.</p>
<p><strong>How Do I Know If There’s Creosote In My Chimney?</strong></p>
<div id="attachment_3315" style="width: 299px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Creosote-F.A.Q.-Nashville-TN-Ashbusters.jpg" class="highslide" onclick="return hs.expand(this)" ><img class="size-medium wp-image-3315" src="http://www.ashbusters.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Creosote-F.A.Q.-Nashville-TN-Ashbusters-289x300.jpg" alt="Ignoring annual chimney cleanings and inspections can be dangerous to your home and your family. Let us help you minimize your risks. " width="289" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Ignoring annual chimney cleanings and inspections can be dangerous to your home and your family. Let us help you minimize your risks.</p></div>
<p>Unlike some other byproducts of combustion — like colorless and odorless carbon monoxide — creosote makes itself known. You may smell a smoky odor coming from your chimney that indicates creosote’s presence, or you might see creosote deposits around your flue opening. Depending on the level of creosote you have (levels 1, 2 an 3 are how hearth professionals categorize the progression of creosote residue), it might look powdery and velvety, crunchy and flaky, thick and drippy or hard and shiny, in colors ranging from brown to black.</p>
<p>But really, here’s the underlying truth about whether or not there’s creosote in your chimney: If you’ve been burning wood in your fireplace or stove, there’s creosote in your chimney. Its development is a natural part of burning wood. The combustion of wood creates a mix of byproducts — including smoke, small particles, tar fog and gases — that rise up the chimney and meet the cooler flue walls, condensing into a liquid. That liquid residue is creosote, and it layers and thickens over time and with use of your appliance.</p>
<p><strong>Can I Stop Creosote From Forming?</strong></p>
<p>You can’t prevent creosote development, but you can use some smart burning practices to limit its build-up. They include the ones we mentioned above — using properly dried wood, and opening your damper completely. Those practices help you develop a fire that’s burning hot enough to encourage proper draft and effective venting.</p>
<p><strong>If Creosote Is So Common, Why Do I Need To Be Concerned About It?</strong></p>
<p>Excessive creosote brings a grab bag of problems along with it. First, there’s the fact that creosote is highly combustible — so the more creosote is lining your flue, the higher the chances of a fire hazard become.</p>
<p>Creosote can also affect your chimney’s ability to vent effectively — if it thickens considerably on your flue walls, it can minimize your chimney’s draft, or even block your flue.</p>
<p><strong>How Do I Get Rid Of Creosote?</strong></p>
<p>On your end, all you need to do to ensure proper creosote removal is to give Ashbusters Chimney Service a call and schedule a <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/services/sweeping/" target="_blank">chimney sweeping  appointment</a>. Our CSIA-certified sweeps use specially designed brushes and tools and a vacuum system with a triple layer HEPA filter to make sure that your flue walls are free of creosote, and your home is free of dust. When professional chimney sweeping is done annually, you can expect your chimney to vent better, longer — and you can rest easy knowing that you’re not leaving a potential fire hazard uncorrected.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about creosote — or want to schedule a chimney sweeping appointment — give Ashbusters a call. We’d love to help you enjoy a clean and well-performing chimney!</p>

Having a working knowledge on this can lessen your bill and ensure the safety of your whole family.</p></div>
<h3>What is it and how does it affect my chimney?</h3>
<p>We talk a lot about combustion in the chimney business, because combustion affects the <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/tag/carbon-monoxide-poisoning/" target="_blank">safety of your chimney</a> and the quality of the air inside your home. We’d like to take a minute to explain what combustion is, so you know exactly how it affects your chimney and your health. Then you’ll be able to make confident decisions about how to operate your fireplace safely, know when you need to have service performed, and why.</p>
<p>Combustion and creosote are partners. Bad combustion equals more creosote, and good combustion equals less creosote. Creosote is a bad by-product of fire, though it’s an unavoidable one. In fact, understanding a little bit about combustion is going to help you understand a whole lot more about creosote. So let’s break it down for you:</p>
<p>Combustion is the <a href="http://www.arb.ca.gov/research/indoor/wood_burning_handbook.pdf" target="_blank">process of burning</a>. Basically, it’s the process that gets us fire. Combustion needs three elements: fuel, heat, and oxygen. The right combination of these three elements oxidizes the fuel, which produces light and heat, and alakazam—ooooo, pretty fire.</p>
<h3>But what does this mean for me?</h3>
<p>In a perfect world, with perfect combustion, this process takes place at exactly the right temperature, and has exactly the right amount of oxygen and fuel. That’s what complete combustion is. This would be a fire that produces no smoke or by-products. Now, as we well know, we don’t live in a perfect world—and try as you might, you’ll never build the perfect fire—which is why you need us.</p>
<p>Combustion as we know it (which is what we call incomplete combustion) produces toxic pollutants that stick to the inside of your chimney (creosote) and affect your health.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) that can cause cancer</li>
<li>Fine particle pollution (ash) that damages lung tissue and creates respiratory problems</li>
<li>Volatile organic compounds (VOCs)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.cpsc.gov/en/Safety-Education/Safety-Education-Centers/Carbon-Monoxide-Information-Center/Carbon-Monoxide-Questions-and-Answers-/" target="_blank">Carbon monoxide</a>, formaldehyde, nitrogen oxides</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s a no-brainer that we all want to avoid these pollutants, so it’s important to know how to operate your fireplace in a way that increases combustion as much as possible to reduce the nasty side effects of incomplete combustion. We’ve got some great info on how to build a good fire, <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/tag/firewood/" target="_blank">how to choose the right wood</a>, and <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/get-chimney-creosote-free/" target="_blank">how to get rid of creosote</a>.</p>
<p>The best way to stay ahead of incomplete combustion is by keeping up with routine chimney maintenance. Have your chimney inspected and cleaned annually. So <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/contact-us/" target="_blank">give us a call</a> when it’s that time of year—when it comes to your chimney, we do it all.</p>

<p>Have you heard about creosote? If your home has a chimney, then you should! No, it’s not some kind of fancy delicacy, although it could sound like it. Creosote is inevitable to any chimney, but it doesn’t mean that it’s something you want to have accumulating in the flue.</p>
<h3>What is Creosote and Why Get Rid of it?</h3>
<p>Creosote is actually one of those chemical by products from burning wood that clings to the inside if your chimney. Generally, a small amount of it will always be present in any chimney with an active fireplace. However, it should not be left unattended or taken too lightly because creosote build-up could be very dangerous. In particular, it will have three levels of build-up, each of which has their own hazards. But the greatest danger of all regarding creosote build-up is the likelihood of developing chimney fires because creosote is flammable. Many times, these fires will go unnoticed within the chimney and further lead to more and more build-up causing a blockage that will interfere with the flow of air out the chimney. This will eventually lead to a dangerous case of carbon monoxide accumulation which is highly toxic. So you can just imagine the myriad of unfortunate events that could stem from unwanted creosote lingering up the chimney flue.</p>
<h3>The Levels of Creosote Build-up</h3>
<p>At the start, creosote will appear flaky or dusty. This is the first degree of creosote build-up. It is attached to the walls loosely so a good <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/services/sweeping/" target="_blank">chimney sweeping</a> will be able to do the trick in removing that unwanted residue. But just because it can be easily removed, doesn’t mean it’s harmless. In fact, because it is very loose and also flammable, there is a good chance that dislodged creosote particles could catch a spark and start a chimney fire all the same. So please do make it a habit to have professionals sweep your chimney to ensure that the cleaning is done properly.</p>
<p>The next level of build-up will have a crunchy and tar-like consistency. This is more difficult to remove as it will require more heavy-duty brushes or even a scraper. If nothing is done at this point, then it will progress further into the next stage.</p>
<p>The third stage of creosote build-up is glazed and gummy or hard. It’s almost like candle wax because it drips down your chimney when exposed to certain temperatures. Then it dries out and becomes hard and glossy again and it could potentially mask some structural damages.</p>
<p>Don’t wait for a chimney fire to break out. Please do not hesitate to give us a call and <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/contact-us/" target="_blank">make an appointment with us </a>at Ashbusters. We always want to put safety first and prevent any untoward incident in your home by making sure your chimney is creosote free.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Burning the Right Kind of Wood</b></p>
<p><b> </b>Newly chopped firewood is approximately 60% water, and that percentage can go even higher. This causes the wood not to burn as well. You need to season the wood first in order to let the liquid dry out until the moisture is around 20% or less. Then, it is ready for an efficient burn. Seasoning firewood means allowing the water content of the wood evaporate, which means not exposing the wood to additional moisture. Drying firewood will make it burn easily and safely.</p>
<div id="attachment_2950" style="width: 295px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Depositphotos_2486706_original-w800-h600.jpg" class="highslide" onclick="return hs.expand(this)" ><img class="size-medium wp-image-2950" alt="Make sure there is air flow in your stacks - Nashville TN - Ashbusters" src="http://www.ashbusters.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Depositphotos_2486706_original-w800-h600-285x300.jpg" width="285" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Make sure there is air flow in your stacks &#8211; Nashville TN &#8211; Ashbusters</p></div>
<p>Burning unseasoned firewood or partially seasoned wood is chancy. Unseasoned wood creates additional creosote. Creosote is the oily sticky substance that doesn&#8217;t burn and is extremely flammable. It takes time before the wood gets fully dried, but it can be done in a stress-free way using some tricks and practices to speed up the process.</p>
<ul>
<li>When chopping wood, make the thickness 6-8 inches and approximately 18” long.  Place the wood outside where it is convenient, yet not so close to the home that you have to worry about <a href="http://entomology.cornell.edu/cals/entomology/extension/idl/upload/Firewood-Insects.pdf" target="_blank">pests</a></li>
<li>Pile the wood correctly so that the wood is not sitting directly on the ground. Put a base under to keep it off the ground and to avoid soil moisture. A pallet is a good base because it is a few inches higher off the ground.</li>
<li>Make space between the wood stack and the wall to sustain air flow. Using a pallet as the base of your stack will also provide air flow to your stack. Air can speed up the drying process.</li>
<li>Only cover the top 1 to 2 feet of the stack, but leave the sides open. Covering any more than that impedes air circulation. If the wood is still green, covering more will just hold in the moisture, and prevent a natural air-dry. Covering just the top also helps keep rain and snow off the wood pile.</li>
<li>Place your pile in a location where it can get the most possible sunlight throughout the day.</li>
</ul>
<p>It can take up to a full year to thoroughly season a pile of wood, so make sure your technique is correct. Remember, seasoned wood is not only safer, as it produces less creosote, but it also gives you a faster and more warming fire. There will also be less smoke if you use dry wood. How do you know  if the wood is <a href="http://ccetompkins.org/energy/heating-wood/storing-and-drying-firewood">dry</a>? If you hit two pieces of wood together and hear a crisp sound, the wood is dry. If the sound is more muffled, you may be dealing with wet wood.  Bottom line: prepare your wood early, keep it stacked to avoid additional moisture and yet still allow air flow. These few tips will help you get the most for your money.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Even though stories portray lighting a fire as simple as getting friction from two sticks and making sparks to start flames, properly lighting your fireplace is a little more difficult.  However, when knowing tips on the right materials and the order to setting up, it can be simple.  First, make sure your fireplace is safe to house a fire.  Checking parts, having a chimney sweep, and other routine maintenance fixes are all important components to a stable fire.</p>
<div id="attachment_2928" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Fireplace-w800-h600.jpg" class="highslide" onclick="return hs.expand(this)" ><img class="size-medium wp-image-2928" alt="Roaring Fire - Nashville TN - Ashbusters" src="http://www.ashbusters.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Fireplace-w800-h600-300x199.jpg" width="300" height="199" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Roaring Fire &#8211; Nashville TN &#8211; Ashbusters</p></div>
<p>First, you should make sure you have all the right types of wood.  For the kindling stage you should use thin branches, generally smaller than a person’s <a href="http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-the-best-way-to-build-a-fire-in-the-fireplace.htm#" target="_blank">wrist</a>.  Softer wood, such as spruce and pine, can also be used for this part of the fire.  The softer wood also contains resin, which can form creosote and put you in more danger of having a house fire.  The logs are also important and should be aged for six to twelve months.  Freshly cut wood will burn unevenly and create both an unpleasant odor and a large amount of smoke.  Woods such as ash, maple, and oak are some of the better choices to use for logs.</p>
<p>Oxygen is also important to building a fire.  The oxygen circulates through the burning pieces keeping the fire moving as fuel is created from the fire.   Tinder is something you will need, usually paper bags, newspapers, or wood chips, to be the base of your fire.  For safety and clean up purposes some handy things to have may be a fireplace screen, stove gloves, and an ash rake.</p>
<p>The first step to building your fire is to place your fire starters and/or your layer of tinder.  Then the kindling is placed on top of that.  Lastly, arrange the logs on the top of the fire.  Remember that moist logs will not light the same as dry wood.  Another hint is placing the logs <a href="http://www.jandlmasonry.com/tips/building-fire-in-fireplace-or-wood-stove/" target="_blank">criss-crossed</a> where the fire can breathe and come up through the spaced between the logs.</p>
<p>Now that you have a few helpful hints you are well on your way to having a nice fire.  Make sure you have proper chimney upkeep, as the fireplace is not the only part working with the fire.  And above all, the most important thing to remember is to never leave your fire unattended.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every year, there are literally thousands of needless deaths caused by building fires. Sadly, many of these deaths are preventable with proper care and preventative maintenance in place. Creosote buildup is one of the major causes of home fires, and is something which every homeowner with a fireplace needs to be aware.</p>
<p>Creosote is a residue created from burning fires. It will appear as a gooey buildup and is extremely flammable. If this substance accumulates in the fireplace or chimney, the home is more susceptible to an accidental fire. As little as 1/8&#8243; of buildup is more than enough to cause a chimney fire. Fires of this nature often spread very quickly, and cannot be extinguished easily with home fire safety devices, such as a fire extinguisher. It is for this reason that preventative maintenance should be scheduled.</p>
<p>It is recommended that a fireplace safety inspection be conducted every year. Ideally, this inspection will take place at the end of the summer or early fall before the fireplace is put to use again. What many homeowners do not realize is that even though the fireplace is not in use, it serves as an exhaust for the home. In addition, there is the chance of buildup from outside sources. This can serve as an additional accelerant, and make it even more likely that a fire will occur.</p>
<p>While there are some products that can be purchased, it is recommended that a professional chimney sweep conduct both the inspection and the cleaning process. The average homeowner does not have the expertise or experience to ensure their chimney is indeed cleaned and safe to use. If there is ever an area where it is better to be safe than sorry, a fireplace and chimney free of creosote buildup is it!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soot" target="_blank">Chimney soot</a> is fine black or dark brown powder formed due to incomplete combustion of wood or coal in a confined place. Hence it can be correctly referred to as the byproduct of fireplace combustion. Soot is formed in a temperature lower than 284 degrees. When fuel like wood, or charcoal burns, it breaks down and deposits itself as a powdery dust called soot. It is also responsible for giving a fire its yellow or reddish orange color as it radiates colors in the red to yellow spectrum. The other common names for chimney soot are lamp black and carbon black. It forms a common ingredient in the making of shoe polish.</p>
<p>Due to its color and texture, soot tends to darken or stain surfaces. It stains ventilations, walls, ceilings, floors, clothes, and even skin, and to do that, it is not even required in large proportions or concentrations. Since it is not burnt totally, creosote is slightly sticky and tends to cling to surfaces like exhaust pipes and chimney flue. Due to its blocking tendency, numerous problems can arise. Let us take a look at what they are:</p>
<ul>
<li>A clogged or blocked chimney is not able to draw in air smoothly. Hence fires become smoky and consume more and more fuel.</li>
<li>If creosote accumulates in the chimney in a substantial quantity, it may be the cause of chimney fires. This is one reason why chimneys should be regularly inspected and cleaned.</li>
<li>If soot falls back into the house through the chimney, the floors can get dirty and messy. This happens when the byproduct accumulates in the chimney, and due to the back-suction of air, it gets pulled back towards the inside of the house. Soot can stain carpets and floors and cleaning it up can get extremely messy.</li>
<li>Being a carbon byproduct, soot can also become a health hazard. If inhaled in proportional quantities, it can affect the lungs and result in lung diseases and respiratory infections. This happens as soot contains polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in its gaseous form. This is not only harmful, but is also difficult to treat in case one acquires a serious infection or illness from this by product.</li>
</ul>
<p>Chimney soot and creosote is inevitable and will be formed due to the use of a fireplace. So to avoid it, the only choice is to get your chimney cleaned.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When combustion takes place, there is always going to be part of the burn fuel that is left over in the form of gas. These unburned gases gather into a tarry, sticky substance that builds up on the walls of the chimney. This substance is called creosote.  Other places where this can originate are the furnace and stoves. Families who use candles often may even see these substances forming in various parts of the house. It may not look like much, but beware. Creosote can cause dangerous situations.</p>
<p>Wood is a good fuel source for any fire. This means that anywhere in the house where it is burned, creosote can build up, and become a fire hazard. Make sure that you clean these areas regularly. Also, you need to check your appliances to see if any of the wiring is near a fireplace. Any spark that comes from the fireplace can cause the cord to burn, and maybe start a fire. You can also minimize the buildup of creosote by <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/about-us/frequently-asked-questions/firewood/">using wood that is well-seasoned</a>. Wood that still has a lot of moisture in it releases much more creosote into the chimney than dry wood. That moisture keeps the chimney from burning safely and efficiently. Remember, it can take a long time to properly season wood, so you will need to plan ahead each year during the cold season.</p>
<p>It is important to remember that you can never completely avoid creosote buildup. It is a naturally occurring chemical reaction.  The key is to have it removed regularly, so that the buildup doesn’t lead to a dangerous situation. This is precisely why we recommend yearly or twice yearly chimney inspections. These inspections not only keep you safe, but also give you the peace of mind that you are doing everything in your power to keep your family safe.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Newly chopped firewood is approximately 60% water, and sometimes even more. This causes the wood to burn less efficiently. You need to season the wood first in order to allow the water to dry out until the moisture is around 20% or less. Then, it is ready for burning. Seasoning firewood means letting the water content of the wood evaporate. Drying firewood will make it burn easily, safely and efficiently. Burning unseasoned firewood or partially seasoned wood is dangerous. It can cause a fire due to the creosote that can build up in the chimney. It takes time before the wood gets fully dried, but it can be done in an easy way using some tricks and techniques to speed up the process.</p>
<ul>
<li>When chopping wood, make the diameter 6-8 inches and 18” long.  Place the wood outside.</li>
<li>Pile the wood properly. Put a base under to keep it off the ground and to avoid soil moisture. A pallet is a good base because it is a few inches higher off the ground.</li>
<li>Put space between the wood stack and the wall to maintain air flow. Using a pallet as the base of your stack will also provide air flow to your stack. Air can speed up the drying process.</li>
<li>Only cover the top 1 to 2 feet of the stack. Leave the sides open. Covering any more than that inhibits air circulation and moisture release. If the wood is still green, covering more will just hold in the moisture, and prevent air flow. Covering just the top also helps keep rain and snow off the wood pile.</li>
<li>Place your pile in a location where it can get the most possible sunlight throughout the day.</li>
</ul>
<p>It can take up to a full year to thoroughly season a pile of wood, so make sure your technique is correct. If you do it right, you’ll have perfectly seasoned wood for your home.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Having a nice, warm, and cozy fireplace where you can relax and snuggle with your loved ones is the perfect thing to come home to from a long, cold, and tiring day. Our fireplaces have indeed given us that sense of relief and comfort. But sometimes we fail to take care of the things that give us pleasure. Just like the simple task of <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/services/sweeping/">cleaning and maintaining our fireplaces and chimneys</a>. We should never take this for granted because as they bring much satisfaction and enjoyment, they could also bring a great deal of danger to our homes and our lives if they are not properly maintained.</p>
<p>There are many harmful things that spring from a poorly cleaned chimney. Smoke can easily circulate in the house instead of exiting the chimney which can suffocate the people inside.  Also, a chimney fire could get out of control, and burn down the roof, ceiling, attic, or even the entire house. One reason for chimney fires is the substance called creosote. This tar-like substance is formed from smoke, gases, vapor, minerals, volatile hydrocarbon, and other particles that are supposed to escape through the chimney flue. But due to the cooler temperature of the chimney walls, it causes a reaction called condensation to occur which transforms these particles into creosote. Instead of freely going out of the chimney, they stick to the chimney flue’s walls. What’s very dangerous about it is that it is extremely combustible. Too much build-up of this in the chimney flue can easily start a chimney fire and can even explode in severe cases.</p>
<p>Factors such as the chimney’s cooler temperature, restricted air supply, and burning unseasoned wood can greatly increase the production of creosote. This is why regular chimney sweeping should be done. It should be free of creosote build-up. The surest way to prevent accidents from ever occurring is by taking care of your fireplace and your chimneys. It’s just a small price to pay considering all the comfort and joy it brings.</p>
