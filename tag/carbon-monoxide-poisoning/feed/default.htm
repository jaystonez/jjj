				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The threat of carbon monoxide poisoning can happen in your home. A scary thought? Neglecting regular chimney maintenance can result in carbon monoxide leaking into your home without you even realize it. Odorless, tasteless, and invisible, this toxic gas can even become trapped within your house. If you do not have a carbon monoxide alarm installed to alert you, you and your family could fall prey to illness or death from continuously inhaling large amounts of this gas. To be even safer from the dangers of carbon monoxide poisoning, an annual chimney sweeping and inspection from a Chimney Safety Institute of America (CSIA)-certified company like Ashbusters can stop this gas from becoming a problem. We would like to inform you about these dangers so that you can protect yourself and your family.</p>

<h3>How Does Carbon Monoxide Affect My Body?</h3>
<p>When you breathe in carbon monoxide, the poisonous gas enters your bloodstream. What your blood naturally does with this gas is the true danger. Hemoglobin, a protein in your blood, chooses to pick up and carry the carbon monoxide and to ignore oxygen. Of course, we need oxygen flowing through our bloodstreams to keep our cells from suffocating. The amount of damage caused depends on how long and how intensely you are exposed to inhaling carbon monoxide.</p>
<h3>How Common Are Deaths and Illnesses Due to Carbon Monoxide Poisoning?</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.csia.org/homeowner-resources/Avoiding_Carbon_Monoxide_Hazards.aspx" target="_blank">According to the CSIA</a>, at least 200 people in the U.S. are killed every year from carbon monoxide poisoning caused by venting problems in their heating systems. Approximately 10,000 cases of sickness related to carbon monoxide are recorded each year as well.</p>
<h3>What are the Side-Effects and Symptoms of Carbon Monoxide Poisoning?</h3>
<p>Side-effects of low-level exposure can include permanent brain and other organ damage. Unfortunately, the symptoms of low-level poisoning are much like those of the common cold: headache, dizziness, fatigue, and nausea. This causes many misdiagnoses of carbon monoxide poisoning, which prolongs the exposure. If these symptoms do not go away, be persistent with your doctor and ask for a blood test to check for levels of this toxic gas. The sooner high levels are found, the sooner life-saving treatment can begin.</p>
<h3>How Does This Gas Enter My House?</h3>
<p>Poor ventilation is the primary cause of carbon monoxide coming into your home; however, the factors behind the venting problems include a damaged or missing chimney flue liner, large deposits of creosote, debris clogging the passageway, and nesting from birds or other animals blocking the flue.</p>
<h3>How Can I Stop Carbon Monoxide from Entering My Home?</h3>
<p>All of the factors behind chimney ventilation problems can be corrected with an annual chimney sweeping and inspection from Ashbusters. With cases of carbon monoxide-related health issues on the rise, our CSIA-certified chimney sweeps will clean out any blockages, check flue liners for damaging cracks, and replace a deteriorated chimney liner to protect you from the dangers of carbon monoxide poisoning.</p>
<p>If you have not scheduled your annual chimney sweeping and inspection this year, contact Ashbusters today. Our staff will arrange a chimney sweep visit to your home as soon as possible.</p>

Make sure your chimney is always clean.</p></div>
<p>If you have a chimney, chances are you have had something stuck inside it at some point. A chimney blockage can be a dangerous situation; as stated by the <a href="http://www.csia.org/homeowner-resources/the_facts_about_chimney_fires.aspx" target="_blank">Chimney Safety Institute of America</a> (CSIA), a dirty chimney can cause a chimney fire. One of the main reasons an annual <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/services/sweeping/" target="_blank">chimney sweep</a> is so important, proper maintenance of your chimney prevents your chimney from blockages as everything is cleaned out and removed in the chimney sweep process. We at Ashbusters provide the best chimney sweep in town, and our CSIA-certified technicians will remove the following common chimney blockages when they are stuck in your chimney.</p>
<h3>Animals</h3>
<p>When the cold weather comes, animals like birds, squirrels, and raccoons come looking for a warm place to nest for the winter, and your chimney may become a chosen home. This can create a very perilous situation as not only could it cause a dangerous fire if you light a fire while the animal is inside your chimney, but if the animal becomes stuck, it could die, leaving it to spread foul, putrid fumes through your house. You should never try to remove a wild animal from a chimney yourself. Always call professionals like Ashbusters. We are <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/services/sweeping/" target="_blank">qualified</a> with removing animal debris, and if need be, we can contact a professional animal remover if an animal is still alive.</p>
<h3>Debris</h3>
<p>Even though you may have a chimney cap, leaves, trash, and settlement still seem to get into your chimney and accumulate. After a period of time, this accumulation can cause a blockage large enough to cause incomplete combustion and negative air pressure, driving smoke back into your house. Also, if you allow settlement to build up long enough, it causes cracks in your flue, and then you will have dangerous, poisonous carbon monoxide leaking into your house.</p>
<h3>Creosote</h3>
<p>If you have a wood-burning stove, you have creosote deposits building up on the walls of your chimney, and if you go too long without a chimney sweeping, creosote can build up large enough to be a hazardous blockage. According to the <a href="http://www.csia.org/homeowner-resources/the_facts_about_chimney_fires.aspx" target="_blank">CSIA</a>, creosote is formed naturally in the wood-burning process. When the by-products of combustion (smoke, vapors, tar fog, gases, hyrdocarbon, unburned wood particles, etc) exit your fireplace and go out your cooler chimney, condensation occurs, and the result is creosote residue. Black or brown in appearance, creosote can be sticky and tar-like, shiny and hardened, or crusty and flaky, but no matter what it looks like, it is a dangerous, highly-combustible compound that is the leading cause of chimney fires. Luckily, your annual <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/services/sweeping/" target="_blank">chimney sweep</a> will take care of all of the creosote build-up in your chimney. The CSIA-certified chimney sweeps at Ashbusters are highly trained to remove all creosote deposits from your chimney, making it safe from chimney fires.</p>
<p>Although, the “something is stuck in my chimney!” situation sounds dire and can be an emergency, there is a simple solution: <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/contact-us/" target="_blank">contact</a> Ashbusters today for a professional chimney sweep to get the blockage out of your chimney and safely enjoy your fireplace again.</p>

<div id="attachment_3195" style="width: 265px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/All-About-Carbon-Monoxide-Nashville-TN-Ashbusters-Chimney.jpg" class="highslide" onclick="return hs.expand(this)" ><img class="size-medium wp-image-3195" alt="Don't fall prey to this deadly gas.

Eliminate the risks of carbon monoxide poisoning by having regular inspections and being alert!</p></div>
<h3>What is Carbon Monoxide?</h3>
<p>Carbon Monoxide is an odorless, colorless gas that is extremely toxic. Once it enters the bloodstream, it begins to compete with the current oxygen levels. CO can be released into the air by using everyday appliances, such as generators, vehicles, and also your fireplace. If you are around one of these, make sure the area you are in is open. If the appliance has a vent, arrange where the fumes go outside. Lastly, never use something to heat your home that is not intended for that purpose, such as a gas oven, and do not leave other heating methods unattended or on overnight.</p>
<h3>How can you prevent carbon monoxide from getting in the air?</h3>
<p>Chimney draft is important when talking about carbon monoxide because if the draft cannot appropriately pull air through the home and out for the chimney, it will remain in the home. You can adjust the draft pressure by changing the heat of the fire or changing the physical structure of the chimney.</p>
<h3>Reasons draft is compromised</h3>
<p>Often times a draft’s flow can be disrupted. One of the most common and avoidable reasons is an abundance of creosote build up inside of the chimney. Creosotes are combustion particles released as firewood is burned that clump together as the make their way up the chimney. This is one of the reasons you should always make sure your chimney sweep is<a href="http://www.csia.org/homeowner-resources/how_to_hire_a_chimney_sweep.aspx" target="_blank"> Chimney Safety Institute of America</a> (CSIA) certified. CSIA has a list of set guidelines they use to ensure that you appointment is worth your time and will keep you safe. Other things that could cause draft problems include clogged dampers and dirty chimney caps.</p>
<h3>Other sources of potential trouble</h3>
<p>Other than draft problems, carbon monoxide can build up when other equipment is consuming the same clean air that is being vented within the house. If you use exhaust fans when you’re using a fuel-burning heater or stove, only run the fans for a few minutes at a time. Prolonged usage could remove too much air and waste heat. Also, do not run any power attic vents during the winter. When a fireplace or woodstove is running, open a window and turn off anything that releases warm air. You can also try replacing the air duct that connects to the fireplace so it does not steal air from your furnace.</p>
<h3>How can I protect my family?</h3>
<p>Now companies have invented CO alarms that you can install in your home to be alerted if levels in the area become dangerous. To get the best results, spread multiple alarms throughout the home, especially if there are multiple levels or an open floor plan. Some systems are built where you can connect them so that when one sounds they all go off. These alarms should be used with smoke detectors, not instead of, and should be tested periodically.</p>
<h3>What does CO poisoning feel like and how is it treated?</h3>
<p>Because of the state of carbon monoxide, people cannot tell when it begins to fill a room. This is detrimental to a person’s health because they will intake more than their body can handle before they even realize it. There are differing levels of symptoms you can have depending on how much of the gas you take in. Mild symptoms are flulike and include nausea, dizziness, headache, and fatigue, while the more severe symptoms can lead to fatality. If someone in your home has a medical condition they may react differently or more quickly, while people with heart and breathing conditions will begin to experience chest pain.</p>
<p>If you or the people around you begin to feel these symptoms, you should evacuate the area immediately, even if you cannot get to whatever is releasing the gas to turn it off. You should also seek immediate medical attention. Patients who have had minimal exposure should be able to be treated in office, but in extreme cases they may have to be admitted into a hospital to receive oxygen to normalize levels.</p>
<p>If you have any additional questions about the risks of carbon monoxide or want to schedule your annual chimney inspection, <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/contact-us/" target="_blank">call us today</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever thought of the safety of your fireplace? There are many incidents which could be very dangerous for you and your family if the fireplace is not safe. One of which is carbon monoxide poisoning. Carbon monoxide poisoning claims an average of 3,000 to 4,000 lives each year, and the reason behind it is the poor maintenance of the fireplace. This is the result of incomplete burning in the fireplace. A low level of poisoning will cause flu-like symptoms to someone who is exposed to carbon monoxide. This would make the person think that they are just having the regular flu. However, advanced poisoning would progress to vomiting and headache, which would eventually lead to death. This is because the body sometimes prefers carbon monoxide over oxygen when the two are present in the atmosphere. That is why it is very important to know the safety status of your fireplace.</p>
<p>Chimney fires are a major threat to your property. This is caused by creosote buildup in the chimney. Creosote is a gummy, tar-like substance which can be found in the flue. This substance can catch fire and the first stage of the fire cannot be noticed immediately. However, when creosote catches fire, it has a sound which would be like a jet on a low altitude. The most common accident which involves fireplaces is chimney failure. Due to wear and tear the bolts and bricks may eventually wither and break. First signs of this are cracks that you may find in some of the visible masonry. However, another reason for the wear and tear of the chimney is poor maintenance. That is why it is highly advised to have your <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/services/inspections/">chimney maintained by experts</a> who know all about what to do. Have your chimney checked to answer the question: is your fireplace safe?</p>
