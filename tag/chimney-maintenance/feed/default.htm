				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Before you light your first fire of the season,it is recommended by national fire safety organizations like The Chimney Safety Institute of America (CSIA) and The National Fire Prevention Association (NFPA) that you should schedule your annual chimney sweeping and inspection. Our CSIA-certified chimney technicians at Ashbusters agree. In Middle Tennessee, we are fortunate to have warm early fall temperatures; however, we never know when a cold snap may surprise us. By preparing your fireplace and chimney for winter before the fall season gets underway, you will be a step ahead and will not have to wait for weeks for a chimney sweep and inspection appointment. Getting your fireplace and chimney ready to use for the cold months of the year is smart chimney maintenance, and we would like to answer some of your questions about the winter preparation of a chimney.</p>
<p><a href="http://ashbusters.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/yearly-chimney-maintenance-nashville-tn-ashbusters.jpg" class="highslide" onclick="return hs.expand(this)" ><img class="size-medium wp-image-3566 alignright" src="file:///N:/Users/PZ/Documents/My Web Sites/Brandoo WordPress (MS SQL or Azure SQL)/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/yearly-chimney-maintenance-nashville-tn-ashbusters-216x325.jpg" alt="Yearly Chimney Maintenance - Nashville TN - Ashbusters" width="216" height="325" /></a></p>
<h3>Why Is It So Important to Get My Chimney Cleaned and Inspected Before Fall?</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.cleveland.com/insideout/index.ssf/2009/10/chimney_fireplace_should_be_ch.html" target="_blank">According to the article</a>, “Chimney, Fireplace Should Be Checked Before Winter Sets In,” from the <em>Cleveland Plain Dealer</em>, statistics back up the importance of having your annual chimney cleaning and inspecting done before you begin using your fireplace for the winter. 24,500 residential fires originating from the chimney and fireplace occurred in the year 2005, as cited by the US Consumer Product Safety Commission. These fires claimed the lives of 20 people and damaged about $126 million worth of property. A professional chimney sweeping will be sure your chimney is free from fire hazards.</p>
<h3>What Is the Greatest Fire Hazard of a Dirty Chimney?</h3>
<p>The main culprit behind chimney fires is creosote building up on your chimney walls. Highly flammable deposits, creosote is the natural result of the condensation that occurs when the by-products of combustion like smoke, gases, and vapors exit the cooler upper chimney walls. Creosote eventually turns into a baked-on glaze inside your chimney, which, if the temperatures reach a high enough point, will ignite the chimney liner and the walls. Ashbusters has years of experience is cleaning the glazed creosote from chimneys and making the chimneys safe to use throughout the winter months.</p>
<h3>What Else Does Ashbusters Do to Prepare My Chimney for Winter?</h3>
<p>When we perform our chimney sweeping and inspection, we also:</p>
<ul>
<li>examine the exterior of your chimney on the roof to check the chimney cap, the flashing, and the masonry work to be sure there are no signs of damaging water penetration</li>
<li>ensure your damper opens and closes properly</li>
<li>make sure there is a clearance of at least 18 inches from your fireplace to anything that could be combustible, such as furniture and curtains</li>
<li>inspect the chimney liner for cracks and other damage</li>
<li>protect your safety by being sure there is some sort of screen in front of your fireplace</li>
<li>advise you on proper ash removal.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have not scheduled your annual chimney sweeping and inspection yet, <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/contact-us/">contact us</a> today. We will arrange an appointment for our CSIA-certified technicians to prepare your chimney for winter.</p>

<p>Failing to prepare your fireplace and chimney for the conditions to which they will be subjected is surely preparing them to fail under said conditions.  If chimney maintenance isn’t at or near the top of your to do list, it should be!</p>
<p>We really put our chimney systems through the wringer during the heating season; we owe it to them to have a thorough, annual <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/services/inspections/">inspection</a> conducted after periods of heavy use so as to provide additional peace of mind that all things are as they should be.  We encourage you to use the information provided herein and pass it along to your neighbors, friends and family.</p>
<p><strong>Water is the enemy!</strong></p>
<p>Not waterproofing a chimney opens the door to a multitude of problems.  On the other hand, making the choice to waterproof your chimney enables it to repel up to 99.9% of water that could otherwise penetrate and harm all of your chimney system’s components.</p>
<p>The materials used to build most masonry chimneys experience hastened deterioration as a result of prolonged exposure to and contact with water.  The freezing and thawing process — during which time water that has penetrated the various chimney materials freezes and expands — quickly deteriorates the overall construction of your chimney.  Water in your chimney can also cause rust on steel and cast iron parts, ultimately weakening or destroying them.</p>
<p>Your chimney’s exterior is constantly battered by the weather.  Harsh weather conditions can have a negative effect on your chimney.  In addition, when water mixes with the creosote that is often present in a wood-burning fireplace, it will generate an extremely unpleasant odor that can fill your entire home.  All of these things combined greatly compromise the overall structure of your chimney.</p>
<p><strong>Chimney sweeping is a must!</strong></p>
<p>Basking in the warmth of a roaring fire during the colder months is like a rite of passage for many.  Winter isn’t complete unless there’s a fire burning in the fireplace.  Much preparation goes into making this a reality.  If you don’t put some thought into it before you light your winter fires, your enjoyment could very well be short-lived.</p>
<p>Dirty chimneys can cause chimney fires, which damage structures, destroy homes and injure or kill people; it can also lead to carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning which can harm or kill people as well.  Creosote becomes dangerous when it’s allowed to accumulate in your chimney.  Although the buildup cannot be avoided completely, burning small, hot fires and using dry, seasoned wood can minimize the buildup.</p>
<p>Sooner or later, every chimney needs to be cleaned to remove creosote buildup.  It’s highly recommended that you leave this task to a CSIA-certified chimney sweep.  The frequency for your cleanings will vary based on the amount of use your fireplace receives, but it should never be any longer than a year between cleanings, as the likelihood of a clean chimney catching fire or producing deadly levels of CO is far less than a dirty one.</p>
<p>When you go too long without keeping up with those critical items on your honey do list, you can find yourself creating bigger home repair expenses for yourself.  As many homeowners can attest, small problems can become big problems when routine maintenance is neglected.</p>
<p>The best way to maintain a fully functioning and safe chimney system is to hire CSIA-certified chimney pros like Ashbusters to ensure your maintenance is done right the first time, every time.  We know we’re not the only chimney service in town; however, we believe we are the best and would greatly appreciate it if you would give us the opportunity to prove it!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_3448" style="width: 209px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/All-About-Spalling-Nashville-TN-Ashbusters.jpg" class="highslide" onclick="return hs.expand(this)" ><img class="size-medium wp-image-3448" src="http://www.ashbusters.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/All-About-Spalling-Nashville-TN-Ashbusters-199x300.jpg" alt="As time goes by, things wear out and become more prone to damage.

The same holds true for your chimney masonry. Spalling is one thing that can happen to it.</p></div>
<h3>What Is Spalling?</h3>
<p>All kinds of crazy things can happen to your chimney masonry. One look at our <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/services/chimney-repairs/chimneys-gone-wild/" target="_blank">Chimneys Gone Wild</a> page [link to ] will show you that.</p>
<p>One of the problems that Ashbusters sees most often with chimney brick in Nashville is something called “spalling.” Spalling can afflict just about any sort of stone surface; patios, walkways, and pool decks are also prone to spalling. Spalling bricks may be found both on both the inside and outside of your chimney. Only a professional chimney inspection will reveal whether or not the brick inside your chimney is in good shape. In fact, we would only recommend hiring a chimney technician—rather than a brick mason—to repair your chimney brick, as chimneys face specific problems and serve purposes that only a C.S.I.A. [www.csia.org] trained sweep will be able to properly address.</p>
<h3>How can I tell if my chimney is spalling?</h3>
<p>You will be able to identify a spalling problem if it looks like the face of your chimney brick, even a small portion of it, has popped off or is flaking off.</p>
<h3>Why is my chimney spalling?</h3>
<p>This is brick’s natural response to water intrusion and to the freeze/thaw cycle. Brick and mortar can unfortunately be quite porous if not protected, and water damage will only grow worse over time. The good news though is that there are plenty of ways to safeguard brick from this kind of damage in the future.</p>
<h3>Can you fix my spalling brick?</h3>
<p>Absolutely. Ashbusters handles a wide variety of <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/services/chimney-repairs/chimney-masonry/" target="_blank">masonry repairs</a>. In most cases, if we find that the interior of your chimney is spalling or cracking, we will recommend that you reline it or use a chimney resurfacing system that will fill in any gaps, making your chimney safe for use again. If your exterior brick is spalling, we will replace the damaged bricks and mortar. We can also tuckpoint to fill in any mortar gaps.</p>
<h3>Can you protect my brick so it doesn’t spall again?</h3>
<p>Yes, we highly recommend a service called chimney waterproofing. It is a good idea to waterproof your chimney after you have had spalling problems or other masonry repairs taken care of; this will seal your repair work for the next decade at least.</p>
<p>Do you have a chimney in need of repair? Call Ashbusters today!</p>

Be aware of the common causes of a leaky chimney so you can help prevent it.</p></div>
<p>Unfortunately, when you have a masonry chimney, sooner or later, it is going to leak. According to the <a href="http://www.csia.org/homeowner-resources/water_and_your_masonry_chimney.aspx" target="_blank">Chimney Safety Institute of America</a> (CSIA), water is your masonry chimney’s biggest enemy. This is due in large part to the fact that the outer part of your chimney is exposed to rain, moisture and the elements, which leads to water penetrating the porous brickwork and mortar of your chimney. This water penetration causes extensive and expensive damage, ranging from rusted fireplace and chimney parts to rotted wood and stained walls and ceilings; extreme cases can even result in moderate to severe chimney structural damage.</p>
<p>You believe you have protected your chimney from water penetration and cannot seem to figure out what is causing your chimney to leak? The CSIA-certified chimney technicians at Ashbusters are experienced at finding the point of origin of chimney<a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/services/chimney-repairs/chimney-leaks/" target="_blank"> leaks</a>, determining what is causing the leak, and repairing the leak, along with any damage it has caused to your chimney and fireplace.</p>
<p>As chimney leaks are difficult to pinpoint, it is helpful to know their main causes. To give you a better idea of where you should focus your attention, the home improvement website, Improvenet by CraftJack, provides the following common sources of chimney leaks:</p>
<h3>1. The Mortar Crown or Chimney Cap</h3>
<p>If the mortar around the top of your chimney begins to crack and crumble, or if you have a damaged chimney cap with cracks and chips, rainwater is leaking into your chimney from the very top. Since both bricks and mortar are porous, water can be absorbed into your chimney walls and leads to gradual deterioration from within. The solution to this problem is simple, and Ashbusters can help you in selecting and installing a new <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/catalog/chimney-caps/" target="_blank">chimney cap</a> or creating and installing a customized <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/services/chimney-repairs/chimney-masonry/" target="_blank">masonry</a> chimney crown and repairing the damaged bricks and mortar around it.</p>
<h3>2. Deteriorating Mortar Joints</h3>
<p>When mortar joints age and erode, holes develop, and water has another passageway through which to enter the chimney. The amount and size of these holes can and will vary and can become large enough to allow a sizable amount of water in during a heavy rain. Even if the hole is small, water can still seep into the joint, travel to a hole in the brick, and maneuver its way down the chimney. Ashbusters can save the day with our years of masonry and solve this problem by repointing the deteriorated mortar joints with new mortar.</p>
<h3>3. Flashing</h3>
<p>Your flashing, the metal sheeting that protects the area where your chimney meets your roof, is a common place for water to penetrate your chimney. Even if it looks like it is securely covering the area around your chimney, it only takes one tiny hole for water to enter the chimney. The best solution to this problem is to have your flashing professionally re-fitted and installed. We at Ashbusters are experienced with building complete <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/services/chimney-repairs/chimney-masonry/" target="_blank">masonry chimneys</a>, so our CSIA-certified technicians can take care of this flashing job for you.</p>
<h3>4. The Roof Shingles Around the Chimney</h3>
<p>This is the least common cause for a chimney leak, but if the experts at Ashbusters cannot find the leak in the other 3 areas or anywhere else, you more than likely have damaged and/or loose roof shingles. To solve this problem, you will need to call a roofing expert to diagnose this problem and repair it by replacing the shingles.</p>
<p>If you suspect you have a leaky chimney, do not hesitate to <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/contact-us/" target="_blank">contact</a> Ashbusters today. We will find the leak and repair your problem quickly.</p>

Make sure your chimney is always clean.</p></div>
<p>If you have a chimney, chances are you have had something stuck inside it at some point. A chimney blockage can be a dangerous situation; as stated by the <a href="http://www.csia.org/homeowner-resources/the_facts_about_chimney_fires.aspx" target="_blank">Chimney Safety Institute of America</a> (CSIA), a dirty chimney can cause a chimney fire. One of the main reasons an annual <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/services/sweeping/" target="_blank">chimney sweep</a> is so important, proper maintenance of your chimney prevents your chimney from blockages as everything is cleaned out and removed in the chimney sweep process. We at Ashbusters provide the best chimney sweep in town, and our CSIA-certified technicians will remove the following common chimney blockages when they are stuck in your chimney.</p>
<h3>Animals</h3>
<p>When the cold weather comes, animals like birds, squirrels, and raccoons come looking for a warm place to nest for the winter, and your chimney may become a chosen home. This can create a very perilous situation as not only could it cause a dangerous fire if you light a fire while the animal is inside your chimney, but if the animal becomes stuck, it could die, leaving it to spread foul, putrid fumes through your house. You should never try to remove a wild animal from a chimney yourself. Always call professionals like Ashbusters. We are <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/services/sweeping/" target="_blank">qualified</a> with removing animal debris, and if need be, we can contact a professional animal remover if an animal is still alive.</p>
<h3>Debris</h3>
<p>Even though you may have a chimney cap, leaves, trash, and settlement still seem to get into your chimney and accumulate. After a period of time, this accumulation can cause a blockage large enough to cause incomplete combustion and negative air pressure, driving smoke back into your house. Also, if you allow settlement to build up long enough, it causes cracks in your flue, and then you will have dangerous, poisonous carbon monoxide leaking into your house.</p>
<h3>Creosote</h3>
<p>If you have a wood-burning stove, you have creosote deposits building up on the walls of your chimney, and if you go too long without a chimney sweeping, creosote can build up large enough to be a hazardous blockage. According to the <a href="http://www.csia.org/homeowner-resources/the_facts_about_chimney_fires.aspx" target="_blank">CSIA</a>, creosote is formed naturally in the wood-burning process. When the by-products of combustion (smoke, vapors, tar fog, gases, hyrdocarbon, unburned wood particles, etc) exit your fireplace and go out your cooler chimney, condensation occurs, and the result is creosote residue. Black or brown in appearance, creosote can be sticky and tar-like, shiny and hardened, or crusty and flaky, but no matter what it looks like, it is a dangerous, highly-combustible compound that is the leading cause of chimney fires. Luckily, your annual <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/services/sweeping/" target="_blank">chimney sweep</a> will take care of all of the creosote build-up in your chimney. The CSIA-certified chimney sweeps at Ashbusters are highly trained to remove all creosote deposits from your chimney, making it safe from chimney fires.</p>
<p>Although, the “something is stuck in my chimney!” situation sounds dire and can be an emergency, there is a simple solution: <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/contact-us/" target="_blank">contact</a> Ashbusters today for a professional chimney sweep to get the blockage out of your chimney and safely enjoy your fireplace again.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Waterproofing Your Chimney to Perfection</b></p>
<p>When your chimney is already undergoing extensive water damage, the costs for repair will soon match or even exceed the money you spent to get it installed in the first place. That’s why preventing this from happening is the smart thing to do for all homeowners who have fireplaces and chimneys. The best way to do this is by <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/services/chimney-repairs/chimney-leaks/" target="_blank">waterproofing your chimney</a>. Taking note of this crucial step in chimney maintenance will help prepare you and your chimney for yet another year of alternating cold, freezing temperatures and warm sunny days. This tip is especially important during the rainy season because you have to make sure that as little water as possible enters your chimney.</p>
<div id="attachment_3156" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Tax-Credit-2013-Long-Island-NY-Beach-Stove-and-Fireplace.jpg" class="highslide" onclick="return hs.expand(this)" ><img class="size-medium wp-image-3156" alt="Keeping the moisture from getting into your chimney is far easier than repairing the damage it can do. It is much less expensive too." src="http://www.ashbusters.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Tax-Credit-2013-Long-Island-NY-Beach-Stove-and-Fireplace-300x262.jpg" width="300" height="262" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Keeping the moisture from getting into your chimney is far easier than repairing the damage it can do. It is much less expensive too.</p></div>
<p>Water is one of the strongest reasons for chimney deterioration. It can seep briskly inside and occupy areas in the masonry bricks. If taken for granted, the moisture can even harbour molds that could be dangerous to the health of the occupants in the house. This will then lead to far bigger problems.</p>
<p>What we would usually recommend here at Ashbusters Chimney Service is to first do a routine inspection of your chimney. This will help our experts assess the condition of your chimney and decide on what to do from there. This can also help us see what the options are and discuss them with you so that you are well informed about the things we will do to help maintain the structure and function of your chimney. For this type of inspection, we use specialized video cameras to check the most delicate areas, especially in the nooks and crannies where water will most likely hide.</p>
<p>When all the repairs are in order, we would definitely advise you to get a chimney cap installed. This will eliminate most water from getting into the chimney through it’s main opening. The chimney cap is the defense system of the chimney, so it needs to be strong and durable to protect the inside area. Usually when the winter season arrives, the endurance of the chimney cap is challenged. Nonetheless, getting a stainless steel chimney cap will do the trick.</p>
<p>Another good way of waterproofing your chimney is to use water repellent. This is applied on the bricks of your chimney walls and other areas that are most likely to be exposed to moisture. This can help strengthen the chimney walls especially when heavy rain starts to pour. Many repellents can be effective for years to specifically strengthen the parts of the chimney that cannot be protected by the chimney cap.</p>
<p>If you feel like your chimney or fireplace needs some sprucing up, then call us at Ashbusters Chimney Service. After over twenty-five years of outstanding service to our clients in Nashville Tennessee and in surrounding towns, we can proudly guarantee a legacy of quality service and dedication. Here, you are always our priority.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You love your fireplace, but do you know how to tell if it is working properly. It may seem like a complicated operation, but the basic physics of how a fireplace and chimney work are relatively easy to understand. Here are some quick tips so you will be able to tell if your fireplace and chimney are working safely and properly when in operation.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2248" title="Ashbusters Chimney - How Your Chimney Works" alt="Ashbusters Chimney - How Your Chimney Works" src="http://www.ashbusters.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/ashbusters-how-your-chimney-works-200x300.jpg" width="200" height="300" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Think of your home as a flow system, where air enters in the bottom and escapes through the top. The airflow of the home is influenced by a variety of factors, including the operation of your fireplace.</li>
<li>When warm air is created, it rises in the home. This is sometimes referred to as the &#8220;stack effect.&#8221; This warm air is trying to escape in any way it can, be it a chimney or crack in the window molding. While this air is trying to escape, colder air is trying to get in. The <a href="http://www.healthyhouseinstitute.com/smallpedia.php?id=623" target="_blank">Neutral Pressure Plane</a>, or NPP, establishes itself somewhere in the home dictating the point where air begins to escape and enter. The areas below the NPP are entry points and the areas above the NPP are exit points.</li>
<li>Wind will also affect the operation of your chimney. When wind hits a building, this causes a high-pressure build up. Downwind, the side of the home away from the wind strike, experiences a low pressure. If there is an opening on the downwind side of the home, it will depressurize the home and can cause a backdraft in the fireplace or chimney, thus resulting in smoke coming into the home.</li>
<li>Other mechanical devices in the home will also affect the performance of your chimney. Appliances and such creating a vacuum or forcing air can make it very difficult for the chimney to perform properly as they are changing the natural flow of air in the home.</li>
<li>Airflow can be restricted in your chimney as well from a lack of preventative maintenance. For example, a wood burning fireplace may experience excessive creosote buildup, leaving a smaller area for the smoke to flow. In addition, this is a major fire hazard. This flow can also be interrupted due to dirty or obstructed dampers, screens, and chimney caps.</li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some homeowners today are choosing to use <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/catalog/fireplaces-and-stoves/contemporary-gas-fireplaces/">pre-fabricated, or factory-built, fireplaces</a>. Instead of being built and tested separately, these units are constructed and tested together to ensure safety and workability. In some cases, the existing foundation supplies ample support for the fireplace, as they are much lighter than a fireplace constructed purely of masonry.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2243" title="Ashbusters Chimney Service can install pre-fabricated fireplaces in your home." alt="Ashbusters Chimney Service can install pre-fabricated fireplaces in your home." src="http://www.ashbusters.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/ashbusters-prefab-fireplace-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" /></p>
<p>Safety during use must be a major concern for homeowners. You should observe the same safety rules you would use for a masonry fireplace.</p>
<ul>
<li>Always leave damper open when fireplace is in use.</li>
<li>Use a fireplace screen to prevent sparks from leaving the fireplace.</li>
<li>Avoid using wet or green wood, as well as overloading the fireplace. Doing so may cause the pile to collapse, resulting in logs rolling out of the fireplace.</li>
<li>Do not use accelerants to ignite fire.</li>
<li>Burning excessive paper or Christmas tree branches can cause damage to interior of chimney.</li>
<li>NEVER install a wood stove in a pre-fabricated fireplace and chimney. They are not designed for this type of use.</li>
<li>Have the fireplace and chimney inspected annually.</li>
</ul>
<p>One advantage of using a pre-fabricated fireplace is in the fact that it can be placed much closer to combustible materials than a regular fireplace. This presents homeowners with a much wider selection of choices and placement in their homes.</p>
<p>While the homeowner may select a traditional design, they will also have the option of choosing something more modern. While a wood stove is not permitted, adjustments can be made to a pre-fabricated fireplace to allow for placement of a gas log. However, ventless logs should not be used unless the fireplace manufacturer specifically states this type of log is acceptable. If this is the case, the damper is left open and the vent free set up is treated in the manner as a gas fireplace needing full venting.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Homeowners who have fireplaces love sitting in front of them on those cold, wintry nights. However, before enjoying the benefits of a fireplace, they need to make sure it is safe to use. Early fall is the perfect time to schedule chimney inspection. Doing so can prevent such things as carbon monoxide poisoning and fires.</p>
<p>When You Should Have Your Fireplace Inspected:</p>
<ul>
<li>New Home Owners &#8211; if you are just moving into your home, it is a good idea to have the fireplace inspected. It is far too risky to take the previous homeowners word that the chimney has been inspected. Have it done yourself just to be sure.</li>
<li>Summer &#8211; as mentioned above, this is the ideal time for an inspection. The chimney will get regular usage and it needs to be cleaned before it is fired up again. The usage from the previous season could have created creosote buildup as well as debris accumulating in the chimney over the course of the spring and summer. In addition, there is the danger of animals nesting in the chimney while it was not in use.</li>
<li>Buildup &#8211; this is a sure sign the chimney needs to be cleaned. Excessive usage will create a creosote buildup. Experts say that as little as one eighth of an inch is enough to cause a house fire.</li>
<li>Gas Fireplaces &#8211; some individuals are under the impression that since they are using a gas fireplace that they need not worry about having their chimney cleaned, but that is far from the truth. There is still the danger of obstructions in the chimney that could cause a fire hazard.</li>
<li>Improper Heating &#8211; when a homeowner notices their home is not being properly warmed by the fireplace, this is a warning sign that something could be wrong. Smoke return or odd smells could mean there is a buildup or blockage in the chimney. If this is the case, do not use it at all until it has been inspected and cleaned by an expert.</li>
</ul>
