				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Making your home a nice and comfortable place to live is very important. This can be achieved a variety of ways, including updating the decor from time to time. Also, you can keep it as a place of comfort by making sure that you clean your house regularly, and by making sure that everything situated in your house is safe for everyone living there. To achieve this, you will have to regularly maintain things like your washer, dryer, stove, and other household appliances. You should always make sure that they are working properly, and that they are not in a position to cause harm in the home. Furthermore, one of the best ways to assure safety is by maintaining a properly functioning chimney. It is one of the most used parts of your home, especially during the winter. That is why, it is very important that you know how to maintain it and to keep it working properly.</p>
<p>First thing that you can do to achieve this is to have it inspected regularly. Hiring a chimney sweep to do the job would be the best thing to do. You should have this performed before the winter seasons hits your place or you could miss your opportunity. Chimney sweeps are generally booked up once the winter starts, because everyone needs help then.  After that, take the advice of the chimney professional. If they finds parts which need to be repaired or replaced, make sure that you follow their recommendations. Then, you can hire them to clean your chimney appliance for you. Remember, keeping it clean can keep your chimney from becoming a dangerous situation. Things like carbon monoxide poisoning and excessive creosote buildup will be a thing of the past.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When combustion takes place, there is always going to be part of the burn fuel that is left over in the form of gas. These unburned gases gather into a tarry, sticky substance that builds up on the walls of the chimney. This substance is called creosote.  Other places where this can originate are the furnace and stoves. Families who use candles often may even see these substances forming in various parts of the house. It may not look like much, but beware. Creosote can cause dangerous situations.</p>
<p>Wood is a good fuel source for any fire. This means that anywhere in the house where it is burned, creosote can build up, and become a fire hazard. Make sure that you clean these areas regularly. Also, you need to check your appliances to see if any of the wiring is near a fireplace. Any spark that comes from the fireplace can cause the cord to burn, and maybe start a fire. You can also minimize the buildup of creosote by <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/about-us/frequently-asked-questions/firewood/">using wood that is well-seasoned</a>. Wood that still has a lot of moisture in it releases much more creosote into the chimney than dry wood. That moisture keeps the chimney from burning safely and efficiently. Remember, it can take a long time to properly season wood, so you will need to plan ahead each year during the cold season.</p>
<p>It is important to remember that you can never completely avoid creosote buildup. It is a naturally occurring chemical reaction.  The key is to have it removed regularly, so that the buildup doesn’t lead to a dangerous situation. This is precisely why we recommend yearly or twice yearly chimney inspections. These inspections not only keep you safe, but also give you the peace of mind that you are doing everything in your power to keep your family safe.</p>
