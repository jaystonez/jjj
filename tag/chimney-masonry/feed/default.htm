<p>If you’ve noticed that your chimney brick or <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/services/chimney-repairs/chimney-masonry/" target="_blank">masonry</a> is loose, crumbling, stained, or otherwise deteriorating, you may have already been thinking you’d like to have it repaired to improve the appearance of your chimney. But did you know that it’s also crucial to repair chimney brick to prevent expensive water damage not only to your chimney but to all areas of your home around your chimney?</p>
<p>In addition to leaks, a <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/services/chimney-repairs/chimney-leaks/" target="_blank">water-damaged chimney</a> can become both a fire hazard and health hazard, no thanks to the accumulation of mold, mildew, and rust. Also, if you spot white streaks down your chimney brick it’s likely something known as “efflorescence,” which is crystallized water and evidence of a problem. But the bottom line is that the more your chimney’s structure is compromised by leaks the less efficient and safe it becomes.</p>
<p>Read on for more on common chimney masonry problems.</p>
<h3>Signs That Your Chimney Brick Needs Repair</h3>
<p>Brick and mortar are both surprisingly porous materials and become even moreso as the years go by and the elements take their toll—especially if your chimney has been left unprotected by a professional waterproofing, which is what we recommend our customers have done following restoration of their masonry. According to the <a href="http://www.csia.org/homeowner-resources/water_and_your_masonry_chimney.asp" target="_blank">Chimney Safety Institute of America</a>, “A chimney deteriorated by constant exposure to the weather can be a potential safety hazard. Weather-damaged lining systems, flue obstructions, and loose masonry materials all present a threat to residents.”</p>
<p>The following are signs that your chimney’s masonry needs attention by a certified chimney mason and tuckpointer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Loose bricks</li>
<li>Crumbling mortar</li>
<li>A stained, streaked, or rusted chimney</li>
<li>A rusted damper or firebox assembly</li>
<li>A “settled” or leaning chimney</li>
<li>Water stains on the ceilings or walls around your chimney</li>
</ul>
<p>Once your chimney has been repaired, there are many surefire ways to prevent future damage, including chimney caps, top-sealing dampers, new or repaired flashing, and waterproofing agents.</p>
<p>Whatever your chimney’s problem, if you live in the Nashville area you can count on Ashbusters to address it and correct it for the longterm.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just like your roof, a chimney is going to degrade over time. This is even true for masonry chimneys. Because of the weather, masonry will expand and contract, causing the mortar to breakdown. Through these cracks, water can trickle down into your home. Many people assume this is a roof leak, but it&#8217;s actually a chimney leak! Besides the risk of water damage, cracked and damaged chimneys are also a major fire hazard. If your chimney is having these types of issues, it is imperative that you have it serviced immediately.</p>
<p>When you do decide to have your chimney inspected, make sure an expert chimney mason is performing the inspection. With their keen eye, they will be able to spot potential problems that are on the horizon, and can suggest possible remedies. The repair itself should certainly be performed by an expert mason. Improper mason work will most likely lead to an even greater damaged chimney, and quite possibly, a chimney fire. Take care of your family and your home, and have someone that knows what they are doing perform the repair.</p>
<p>The best way to prevent expensive damages is to have regular inspections done on your chimney. This will allow you to fix smaller problems quickly, long before they become costly repairs. For instance, if your chimney inspector sees a small crack that is beginning to form in the chimney flue, they can alert you to it right away. This smaller crack can be repaired much more cheaply than a full rebuild of a chimney would be.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t hesitate to <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/contact-us/">contact us</a> if you haven&#8217;t had your chimney looked at in awhile. Don&#8217;t wait until the problem is a dangerous one.</p>
