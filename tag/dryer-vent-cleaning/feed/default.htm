				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ashbusters’ focus on reducing fire hazards for our clients extends well beyond <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/services/sweeping/" target="_blank">sweeping</a> and <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/services/inspections/" target="_blank">inspecting</a> chimneys.  Maintaining dryer vents is a key part of minimizing fire hazards in homes today, too, and that’s why we put as much dedication and care into our <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/services/dryer-vent-cleaning/" target="_blank">dryer vent cleaning services</a> as our chimney service.</p>
<div id="attachment_3132" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/time-to-clean-dryer-vents-Ashbusters-NashvilleTN-w800-h600.jpg" class="highslide" onclick="return hs.expand(this)" ><img class="size-medium wp-image-3132" alt="Be mindful of the signs that tell you your dryer vent needs cleaning." src="http://www.ashbusters.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/time-to-clean-dryer-vents-Ashbusters-NashvilleTN-w800-h600-300x195.jpg" width="300" height="195" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Be mindful of the signs that tell you your dryer vent needs cleaning.</p></div>
<p>Think about it: Just like your chimney, your dryer vents are expelling hot air and byproducts from a heating appliance. So if the vents get clogged, that expulsion is halted, and heat builds up. Since dryer lint is extremely flammable, a clogged dryer vent quickly becomes a serious fire hazard.</p>
<p>Not sure if it&#8217;s time to have your dryer vents cleaned? Here are some simple signs that usually indicate vents that are in need of attention.</p>
<h3>Your Laundry Isn&#8217;t Drying</h3>
<p>Are you running the dryer for a normal amount of time, and still finding damp clothes and towels once the dryer stops? That doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean your dryer is failing. When clogged vents keep heat and moisture from moving out of the home, your dryer has to work harder to try and do its job, and it ends up taking more time, using more energy and taking more money to get your laundry dry. That creates more lint build-up, and makes the situation worse. More often than not, a thorough dryer vent cleaning will get your dryer back to doing its job properly again.</p>
<h3>You Notice Excess Heat On Your Dryer And In The Area Around It</h3>
<p>The harder your dryer has to work, the more heat builds up in the vents and in the machine itself. So if you notice that your dryer is particularly hot, or that it feels warmer in the room around the dryer, that could indicate a clogged vent and an overworked appliance.</p>
<h3>You Smell Something Musty Or Mildew</h3>
<p>If a clogged vent is preventing your dryer from working properly, you may notice a musty odor to your laundry, since dampness isn’t able to escape properly or efficiently.</p>
<h3>You See Excess Lint</h3>
<p>Take a look at the dryer termination outside. Do you see a lot of lint around the opening and going into the ducts? Your eyes don&#8217;t lie &#8212; that build-up means you&#8217;re due for a cleaning.</p>
<p>Ashbusters can help keep your laundry dry and your home safer &#8212; if you&#8217;re due for a dryer vent cleaning appointment, or just want to know more about dryer vent cleaning, give us a call!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/the-longer-the-vent-the-greater-the-need-for-dryer-vent-cleaning/" target="_blank">Dryer vent cleaning</a> is something that many homeowners only think about when there is a specific problem. However, having the vents professionally cleaned is something that should be done on at least an annual basis. Although it may seem like an unnecessary expense when there is nothing wrong, it will save money over time.</p>
<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2901" title="Dryer Vent - Nashville TN - Ashbusters Chimney Service" alt="Dryer Vent - Nashville TN - Ashbusters Chimney Service" src="http://www.ashbusters.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/ashbusters-dryer-vent-hose-300x199.jpg" width="300" height="199" />
<p>If dryer vents are not cleaned regularly, it will significantly decrease the lifespan of the appliance. Having the vents clean may cost money but it is certainly not as expensive as purchasing a completely new dryer. If the dryer is not functioning the way it is supposed to, it is likely that it simply needs to be cleaned. It is important to look into this possibility before purchasing a new machine.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clothes_dryer#Lint_build-up_.28tumble_dryers.29" target="_blank">Having the dryer vents cleaned</a> can also have a positive impact on the home’s energy bill. When the vents are dirty or clogged, the machine has to work much harder in order to do its job. A simple cleaning will make the machine work much more efficiently and save money on the monthly power bill. Over the course of a year, this can add up to significant savings.</p>
<p>If the dryer seems like it may need maintenance, it is important to hire a professional. Many homeowners think that they can handle it on their own and end up doing more damage than good. If a homeowner tries to maintain their dryer themselves and makes a mistake, they will end up spending much more on maintenance or even on a completely new machine.</p>
<p>If energy bills are getting high or the dryer appears to be on the fritz, it is possible to save money by simply cleaning the vents. Regular cleaning allows the machine to work to its full potential, saving the owner a great deal of money. Instead of purchasing a new machine or suffering with expensive bills, consider hiring a professional to clean the vents and improve the dryer’s efficiency.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the best things you can do to improve your home’s fire safety is stop walking away from the stove while you are cooking. Accounting for roughly <a href="http://www.nfpa.org/categoryList.asp?categoryID=282&amp;URL=Safety%20Information/For%20consumers/Causes/Cooking" target="_blank">44 percent of all home fires</a>, the way you cook can be seriously damaging to your family’s well-being! Not only are you what you eat, but how you cook can determine whether your family stays safe.</p>
<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2832" title="Cooking Fire - Nashville TN - Ashbusters Chimney Service" alt="Cooking Fire - Nashville TN - Ashbusters Chimney Service" src="http://www.ashbusters.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/ashbusters-cooking-fire-199x300.jpg" width="199" height="300" />
<p>Another good measure to take is to have your clothes dryer venting professionally cleaned from time to time. How often this needs to be done varies with use and other factors, but dryer vents are notorious culprits in house fires. Highly flammable lint can also gather in air ducts throughout the house, so they should be inspected at the same time.</p>
<p><b>Keep an Eye on Fire </b></p>
<p>Your fireplace system is another obvious thing to attend to regularly; perhaps the most obvious of all. The only place besides the stove where we purposely start indoor fires, the fireplace deserves to be maintained in tip-top condition. The affordable services of CSIA certified chimney sweeps can prevent a lot of avoidable expense and heartache.</p>
<p>Outdoor fireplaces, grills, and fire pits start their share of house fires, either through inattention to their condition or carelessness in their use. Grills and fire pits should never be placed close to the house or flammables, and they need a steady surface beneath them. They also have to be watched, just like stoves, since a flying spark outdoors can be just as much of a problem.</p>
<p><b>Nothing Tasty About Smoked Houses</b></p>
<p>From simple things that you can do better yourself to obviously complicated systems that have to be <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/services/">examined by professionals</a>, the effort is worth it. The only thing you want going up in smoke is your salmon under the hood of a clean grill in good condition. So kill the fire where it is, until you can give it some attention and keep it where it belongs.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Common sense tells us that the farther hot air has to travel to escape the house, the harder it is to get it there. The greater the distance of the run, the more force needed to push it outside the home. It is also a matter of common sense that longer ducts increase the need for <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/services/dryer-vent-cleaning/">regular professional cleanings</a>.</p>
<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2577" alt="Longer Dryer Vents Need More Frequent Cleaning" src="http://www.ashbusters.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/ashbusters-dryer-vents-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" />
<p>When lint accumulates in vent ducts, it is often a prelude to a house fire as it is so easily ignited. This is the primary reason to have your dryer vent system inspected and cleaned by a professional. Homeowners attempting to clean the ducts themselves often damage the ducts without realizing it has happened.</p>
<p>Short straight runs of metal vent ducting are highly unlikely to foster an accumulation of lint. Unfortunately, long vents typically do not run in straight lines to the exterior of the house. Rather, they often make 90-degree turns, joined with elbows that are ideal homes for highly flammable lint.</p>
<p>Among other important functions performed, a professional may be able to find a shorter, straighter route to the outdoors. If not, they will at least be able to thoroughly clean the system’s elbows. They will also be able to replace any flexible aluminum ducting that exists with smooth surfaced metal ducts.</p>
<p>The longer the vent, the more likely it is <a href="http://www.lintalert.com/clogged_dryer_vents.htm" target="_blank">to bend and attract lint</a>, making it more difficult to properly clean. Trained professionals have special brushes and tools to make these turns and tricks of the trade that help them accomplish the task more quickly. Not only will this eliminate a common cause of house fires, but it will improve the efficiency of your dryer. That is money in the bank! If you have not had your dryer ducts inspected in awhile, why not call us to check out your system today.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dryer vents are the one aspect of home maintenance that is continuously overlooked. Since the dryer vents are out of sight and out of mind, homeowners do not think to pull out the dryer and give this area a regular cleaning. This is a serious mistake, as allowing a buildup to occur can have devastating results.</p>
<p><a title="FEMA Dryer Vent Statistics" href="http://www.usfa.fema.gov/downloads/pdf/statistics/v13i7.pdf" target="_blank">According to FEMA</a>, almost 3,000 residential fires are reported every year which are directly related to dryers. These fires cause approximately over 100 injuries and about five deaths every year. The percentages of fires are at the highest in January, accounting for about 11 percent of the yearly total. Of all of these fires, about 34 percent are attributed to a dirty dryer vent.</p>
<p>In addition to the fire concerns are performance concerns. If the vent is not clean, it will hinder the dryer&#8217;s ability to properly dry your clothing. One cycle may not be enough to get the clothing dry, resulting in the dryer running more than is usually necessary. This, obviously, will lead to higher energy bills every month, putting extra stress on the family&#8217;s overall finances.</p>
<p>Homeowners can do preventive maintenance by vacuuming out the dryer vent every couple of months. However, it is still recommended to have a professional cleaning done on an annual basis to ensure that everything is removed from the system. While home vacuum cleaners are okay for monthly maintenance, they simply do not have the power of industrial vacuums used in professional cleaning.</p>
<p>There are enough things that can go wrong to create a home fire that homeowners have little control over, but this is not one of them. Dryer vent fires are truly preventable, and a little home maintenance and annual cleaning will go a long way in making sure that your home and family do not fall victim to a needless tragedy.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dryer vent cleaning is a vital part of home safety. Some of the most common preventable house fires are started by excessive lint inside your dryer vent. Lint is highly flammable, and must be removed from your chimney regularly. In addition, make sure you remove the lint from the trap inside the dryer each time you use it. This will go a long way toward keeping your home safe. A report by the U.S. Fire Administration gives out pretty frightening statistics regarding dryer vent fires. Based on data that from 2008 to 2010, these fires caused upwards of $35 million in damages to residences.</p>
<p>Besides having the vent cleaned regularly, you can also watch for certain things. Make sure your dryer vent doesn&#8217;t sag. These low points in the vent can be an easy place for lint to collect. Also, during the cleaning, make sure your dryer vent professional checks for obstructions within the vent. As an added bonus, clear dryer vents use less energy because they don&#8217;t have to work as hard. Being a responsible homeowner means taking care of these tasks that keep everyone living there safe.</p>
<p>If you can&#8217;t remember when you last cleaned your dryer vents, that probably means it is time for another cleaning. <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/scheduling/">Contact us for an appointment</a>, and we&#8217;ll make sure your dryer vent is operating safely.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lint that builds up in the dryer vent can trigger a house fire. It can ignite, and burn quickly if there is not sufficient air circulating from the dryer vent to the outside of the house. Below are some steps to follow for dryer vent cleaning, which will help you avoid a potentially fatal situation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Unplug your dryer. Turn off the gas if the dryer is connected to a gas line. You should move the dryer approximately 2 feet away from the wall.</li>
<li>Loosen the clamp of the vent dryer with a screwdriver. Take the vent away from the dryer.</li>
<li>Remove lint in the vent and the other places where it builds in the back of the dryer. Usually, lint is found toward the end part of the dryer vent&#8217;s hose. If the lint builds up in the middle of the vent hose you can use a rod or stick to push it from the middle to the end of the hose.</li>
<li>Put the vent clamp back on, and move the dryer to its original place.</li>
<li>Go outside the house, and remove the cover of the vent. Remove or take away the cover of the outside vent. The tube of the vent should slip right out. Remove the remaining lint inside the dryer vent. You may have to use rod or stick if there is some that you can&#8217;t reach. Slip the tube of the vent back in, and replace the cover.</li>
<li>Plug-in the dryer, and if it is gas-operated, turn on the gas. Turn on the dryer to check if the air is freely flowing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Take away the panel in the front of the dryer during cleaning. Lint also develops here. While cleaning the dryer vent, avoid sides with sharp edges or any angled blades such as screws inside the dryer. The actual dryer vent cleaning job is not particularly technical or complicated – with the right tools.</p>
<p>Rather than deal with all of this, however, you can just <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/contact-us/" target="_blank">call a certified chimney professional</a> to safely and quickly clean your dryer vent.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When you consider that there are over 40 dryer fires in the US alone each and every day, then you must consider a product that is known to warn you of danger ahead of time. We care because we know this device will save lives. It does all this by monitoring the dryer exhaust system for any issues that might appear as lint builds up over time.</p>
<p>You will be able to follow the LintAlert® by watching a series of LED lights that indicate how your dryer is functioning. If the airflow becomes restricted and dangerous an alarm is sounded to alert you of a potential fire hazard.</p>
<p>When a dryer is struggling to dry clothes, this is an indication that there is an exhaust issue of some sort. Of course, it will eventually show up on the utility bills. What you don’t see is how the combination of excess lint trapped with the hot air that has no where to go can easily catch fire in your home. The number one reason is operational deficiency, including failure to clean!</p>
<p>Because clothes dryers account for over <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/2007_us_fire_admin.pdf" target="_blank">15,000 structure fires</a>, 15 deaths and 400 injuries annually we have decided to not only recommend LintAlert®,  but to also have it available for our customers. Ashbusters believes in maintenance and cleaning for chimneys and dryers and doing everything possible to eliminate any potential fire in your home.  We also know that taking the necessary steps toward safety will give you the peace of mind you and your family deserve. Using LintAlert® as instructed and recommended will give you that peace of mind as well as helps you keep your dryer in tip top shape for fire safety. It will also keep your utility bills as low as possible.</p>
<p>If you have any questions in regard to the LintAlert® or would like to ask any additional questions, don’t hesitate to <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/contact-us/">contact Ashbusters.net</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every year we see too many tragic fires that cause damage to homes and even worse.  The majority of these are totally preventable, and we like to share some of our knowledge with people in order to prevent some of these tragedies.  Some of these may seem rather obvious, but trust me, reminders can never be a bad thing. Sometimes, they are just the thing to help you remember something life saving.</p>
<p>Here are some of the best tips we have come up with:</p>
<ul>
<li>You will hear us talk about this time and time again &#8211; clean your dryer vents. This is one of those maintenance tasks that can absolutely prevent fire. Lint is highly flammable, and needs to be regularly cleaned out of your vents.</li>
<li>Have your chimney inspected. You just never know when a critter has built a nest in your chimney or the mortar in your chimney has started to crack. Either instance can be the precursor to chimney failure and a house fire. Have it inspected at least every year.</li>
<li>Keep space heaters away from curtains and blankets. The is one of the leading causes of house fires in the United States.</li>
<li>Keep matches and lighters away from children. You can&#8217;t expect children to understand how to use them safely, so always supervise kids when they happen to be around them.</li>
<li>Similar to the above tip, don&#8217;t let kids have candles and incense in their rooms.</li>
<li>Pay attention to warning labels. Your home appliances have these warnings as a guide to keep you and your family safe.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to remember that your safety is up to you. You can&#8217;t expect others to look out for you and your family&#8217;s well-being. Be proactive, and keep everyone you love safe from preventable house fires. Do what it takes to keep your home safe.</p>
