				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Before you light your first fire of the season,it is recommended by national fire safety organizations like The Chimney Safety Institute of America (CSIA) and The National Fire Prevention Association (NFPA) that you should schedule your annual chimney sweeping and inspection. Our CSIA-certified chimney technicians at Ashbusters agree. In Middle Tennessee, we are fortunate to have warm early fall temperatures; however, we never know when a cold snap may surprise us. By preparing your fireplace and chimney for winter before the fall season gets underway, you will be a step ahead and will not have to wait for weeks for a chimney sweep and inspection appointment. Getting your fireplace and chimney ready to use for the cold months of the year is smart chimney maintenance, and we would like to answer some of your questions about the winter preparation of a chimney.</p>
<p><a href="http://ashbusters.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/yearly-chimney-maintenance-nashville-tn-ashbusters.jpg" class="highslide" onclick="return hs.expand(this)" ><img class="size-medium wp-image-3566 alignright" src="file:///N:/Users/PZ/Documents/My Web Sites/Brandoo WordPress (MS SQL or Azure SQL)/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/yearly-chimney-maintenance-nashville-tn-ashbusters-216x325.jpg" alt="Yearly Chimney Maintenance - Nashville TN - Ashbusters" width="216" height="325" /></a></p>
<h3>Why Is It So Important to Get My Chimney Cleaned and Inspected Before Fall?</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.cleveland.com/insideout/index.ssf/2009/10/chimney_fireplace_should_be_ch.html" target="_blank">According to the article</a>, “Chimney, Fireplace Should Be Checked Before Winter Sets In,” from the <em>Cleveland Plain Dealer</em>, statistics back up the importance of having your annual chimney cleaning and inspecting done before you begin using your fireplace for the winter. 24,500 residential fires originating from the chimney and fireplace occurred in the year 2005, as cited by the US Consumer Product Safety Commission. These fires claimed the lives of 20 people and damaged about $126 million worth of property. A professional chimney sweeping will be sure your chimney is free from fire hazards.</p>
<h3>What Is the Greatest Fire Hazard of a Dirty Chimney?</h3>
<p>The main culprit behind chimney fires is creosote building up on your chimney walls. Highly flammable deposits, creosote is the natural result of the condensation that occurs when the by-products of combustion like smoke, gases, and vapors exit the cooler upper chimney walls. Creosote eventually turns into a baked-on glaze inside your chimney, which, if the temperatures reach a high enough point, will ignite the chimney liner and the walls. Ashbusters has years of experience is cleaning the glazed creosote from chimneys and making the chimneys safe to use throughout the winter months.</p>
<h3>What Else Does Ashbusters Do to Prepare My Chimney for Winter?</h3>
<p>When we perform our chimney sweeping and inspection, we also:</p>
<ul>
<li>examine the exterior of your chimney on the roof to check the chimney cap, the flashing, and the masonry work to be sure there are no signs of damaging water penetration</li>
<li>ensure your damper opens and closes properly</li>
<li>make sure there is a clearance of at least 18 inches from your fireplace to anything that could be combustible, such as furniture and curtains</li>
<li>inspect the chimney liner for cracks and other damage</li>
<li>protect your safety by being sure there is some sort of screen in front of your fireplace</li>
<li>advise you on proper ash removal.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have not scheduled your annual chimney sweeping and inspection yet, <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/contact-us/">contact us</a> today. We will arrange an appointment for our CSIA-certified technicians to prepare your chimney for winter.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If your fireplace and chimney system  are not working the way that they should, there is a very good chance that there are <a href="http://www.humanesociety.org/animals/squirrels/tips/squirrels-in-chimneys.html" target="_blank">animals in your chimney</a>. The challenge many homeowners face, however, is that they do not know whether the problem is due to an animal or if it has another source. Here are a few telltale signs that may indicate an animal inhabitation.</p>
<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2905" title="Squirrel in the Chimney - Nashville TN - Ashbusters Chimney" alt="Squirrel in the Chimney - Nashville TN - Ashbusters Chimney" src="http://www.ashbusters.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/squirrels-in-chimney-ashbusterschimneyservice-300x211.jpg" width="300" height="211" />
<p>One of the first things that people notice when there is an animal in their chimney is an unpleasant smell. This can be caused by rotting material from the animal’s housing or it could be from the animal’s waste. If there is an unpleasant smell coming from the chimney, it is a good idea to have your <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/services/inspections/">chimney system professionally inspected</a> for signs of animal inhabitation.</p>
<p>Another indication that animals have set up camp in the chimney is excessive noise. Old houses often make noises for a number of reasons, but animal sounds will be a bit different. The sound of scratching or of something scurrying around is a sure sign that there are animals living above the fireplace. Animals within the chimney system pose a health and a fire threat, and must be addressed immediately.</p>
<p>A good look inside of the chimney can also give clues as to whether or not you have animal residents, even if the animals themselves cannot be seen. One thing to look for is any type of nest or outdoor material. It is often also possible to see animal debris, such as waste or fur, accumulating inside of the chimney.</p>
<p>Having animals in the chimney system can be dangerous for both the animal and the homeowner. Many young animals have a hard time finding their way out of the chimney, and can end up dying. Animals and their nests can also cause chimney fires and inefficient heating systems.</p>
<p>If you think you may have an animal living in your chimney, contact a professional sweep immediately. Failure to do so can lead to even bigger problems down the road.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Common sense tells us that the farther hot air has to travel to escape the house, the harder it is to get it there. The greater the distance of the run, the more force needed to push it outside the home. It is also a matter of common sense that longer ducts increase the need for <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/services/dryer-vent-cleaning/">regular professional cleanings</a>.</p>
<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2577" alt="Longer Dryer Vents Need More Frequent Cleaning" src="http://www.ashbusters.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/ashbusters-dryer-vents-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" />
<p>When lint accumulates in vent ducts, it is often a prelude to a house fire as it is so easily ignited. This is the primary reason to have your dryer vent system inspected and cleaned by a professional. Homeowners attempting to clean the ducts themselves often damage the ducts without realizing it has happened.</p>
<p>Short straight runs of metal vent ducting are highly unlikely to foster an accumulation of lint. Unfortunately, long vents typically do not run in straight lines to the exterior of the house. Rather, they often make 90-degree turns, joined with elbows that are ideal homes for highly flammable lint.</p>
<p>Among other important functions performed, a professional may be able to find a shorter, straighter route to the outdoors. If not, they will at least be able to thoroughly clean the system’s elbows. They will also be able to replace any flexible aluminum ducting that exists with smooth surfaced metal ducts.</p>
<p>The longer the vent, the more likely it is <a href="http://www.lintalert.com/clogged_dryer_vents.htm" target="_blank">to bend and attract lint</a>, making it more difficult to properly clean. Trained professionals have special brushes and tools to make these turns and tricks of the trade that help them accomplish the task more quickly. Not only will this eliminate a common cause of house fires, but it will improve the efficiency of your dryer. That is money in the bank! If you have not had your dryer ducts inspected in awhile, why not call us to check out your system today.</p>
