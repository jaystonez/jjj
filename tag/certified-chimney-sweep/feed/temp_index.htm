				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Browsing the telephone book or doing an online search reveals the large number of chimney sweeps in a given area. When considering which individual to contact, homeowners should take several things into consideration. Verifying that the chimney sweep has a <a title="Ashbusters CSIA Certification" href="http://www.csia.org/CSIA-Certified/Mark-Stoner" target="_blank">Chimney Safety Institute of America (CSIA) certification</a> is one of them.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2216" title="Ashbusters Chimney Service - CSIA Certification" alt="Ashbusters Chimney Service - CSIA Certification" src="http://www.ashbusters.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/ashbusters-csia-logo.jpg" width="163" height="160" /></p>
<p>In North America, more than <a href="http://www.csia.org/Certification/" target="_blank">1,300 chimney sweeps have earned the CSIA certification</a>. This credential is considered a measurement of knowledge regarding chimney and venting system evaluation and maintenance. An increasing number of local, state, and federal agencies, insurance underwriters, and industry organizations are acknowledging the CSIA certification as an industry standard. The importance of this designation cannot be understated.</p>
<p>CSIA regularly reevaluates the relevance of this credential and increases credentialing standards to ensure that certified chimney sweeps are the best in the business. Its mission is to help eliminate residential chimney fires, intrusion of carbon monoxide, and other chimney hazards that cause loss of property and lives. Homebuilders, home inspectors, oil and gas heat providers, and real estate agents feel comfortable recommending a CSIA certified chimney sweep to homeowners requiring chimney inspection and maintenance.</p>
<p>The CSIA credential has been in existence for more than three decades. Homeowners use it as a measurement for the technical expertise of their chimney sweeps. Local, regional, and national publications and media including <em>Good Morning America</em>,<em> 20/20</em>, <em>Consumer Reports</em>, and <em>The New York Times </em>have highlighted the knowledge of CSIA certified chimney sweeps, giving the credential national recognition.</p>
<p>When looking for someone to service the chimney, do not settle for anyone who is not CSIA certified. This credential is a testament to the quality of service provided, whether reviewing the status of the chimney or cleaning it. Only chimney sweeps who are CSIA certified are permitted to the use the CSIA Certified Chimney Sweep trademark on their vehicles and in advertising.</p>
