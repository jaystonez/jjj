				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One big thing for homeowners to think about is which type of fireplace do they want. Now this decision can come as they are shopping for a new home, but it can also come when they are thinking about a home remodeling project. It is important to remember that adding a fireplace does not necessarily mean having to have major structural changes to your home. Of course, structural changes are a possibility. It all depends on the choices you make.</p>
<p>One very popular form of fireplace installation is a direct vent gas fireplace. They provide a very efficient way of heating the home, and help homeowners avoid the mess of a traditional wood fireplace. These are powered by either propane or natural gas. You can also get ventless fireplaces that use natural gas or propane, but we do not recommend them. The chance of Carbon Monoxide poisoning is too great.</p>
<p>Electric fireplaces and Pellet stoves are additional types of fireplace appliances. Electric fireplaces are useful for some people, but they have to keep in mind that this type of fireplace can cost you more than a gas alternative. Plus, if you ever experience a power outage, the fireplace is not going to work. Pellet stoves can be a useful alternative to having an insert. Plus, they are probably cheaper in regards to home modifications.</p>
<p>Finally, there is always the good old wood stove and chimney choice. While you may not want to spend the money to add one to an existing home, most new home constructions give you the choice of what you want to do. Many will even let you choose between gas and wood burning. Whatever type of fireplace or stove you are thinking about, make sure you research the various safety precautions that go along with that choice. You want to make sure you are prepared to do whatever is safest for you and your family.</p>
