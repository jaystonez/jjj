Be aware of the common causes of a leaky chimney so you can help prevent it.</p></div>
<p>Unfortunately, when you have a masonry chimney, sooner or later, it is going to leak. According to the <a href="http://www.csia.org/homeowner-resources/water_and_your_masonry_chimney.aspx" target="_blank">Chimney Safety Institute of America</a> (CSIA), water is your masonry chimney’s biggest enemy. This is due in large part to the fact that the outer part of your chimney is exposed to rain, moisture and the elements, which leads to water penetrating the porous brickwork and mortar of your chimney. This water penetration causes extensive and expensive damage, ranging from rusted fireplace and chimney parts to rotted wood and stained walls and ceilings; extreme cases can even result in moderate to severe chimney structural damage.</p>
<p>You believe you have protected your chimney from water penetration and cannot seem to figure out what is causing your chimney to leak? The CSIA-certified chimney technicians at Ashbusters are experienced at finding the point of origin of chimney<a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/services/chimney-repairs/chimney-leaks/" target="_blank"> leaks</a>, determining what is causing the leak, and repairing the leak, along with any damage it has caused to your chimney and fireplace.</p>
<p>As chimney leaks are difficult to pinpoint, it is helpful to know their main causes. To give you a better idea of where you should focus your attention, the home improvement website, Improvenet by CraftJack, provides the following common sources of chimney leaks:</p>
<h3>1. The Mortar Crown or Chimney Cap</h3>
<p>If the mortar around the top of your chimney begins to crack and crumble, or if you have a damaged chimney cap with cracks and chips, rainwater is leaking into your chimney from the very top. Since both bricks and mortar are porous, water can be absorbed into your chimney walls and leads to gradual deterioration from within. The solution to this problem is simple, and Ashbusters can help you in selecting and installing a new <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/catalog/chimney-caps/" target="_blank">chimney cap</a> or creating and installing a customized <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/services/chimney-repairs/chimney-masonry/" target="_blank">masonry</a> chimney crown and repairing the damaged bricks and mortar around it.</p>
<h3>2. Deteriorating Mortar Joints</h3>
<p>When mortar joints age and erode, holes develop, and water has another passageway through which to enter the chimney. The amount and size of these holes can and will vary and can become large enough to allow a sizable amount of water in during a heavy rain. Even if the hole is small, water can still seep into the joint, travel to a hole in the brick, and maneuver its way down the chimney. Ashbusters can save the day with our years of masonry and solve this problem by repointing the deteriorated mortar joints with new mortar.</p>
<h3>3. Flashing</h3>
<p>Your flashing, the metal sheeting that protects the area where your chimney meets your roof, is a common place for water to penetrate your chimney. Even if it looks like it is securely covering the area around your chimney, it only takes one tiny hole for water to enter the chimney. The best solution to this problem is to have your flashing professionally re-fitted and installed. We at Ashbusters are experienced with building complete <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/services/chimney-repairs/chimney-masonry/" target="_blank">masonry chimneys</a>, so our CSIA-certified technicians can take care of this flashing job for you.</p>
<h3>4. The Roof Shingles Around the Chimney</h3>
<p>This is the least common cause for a chimney leak, but if the experts at Ashbusters cannot find the leak in the other 3 areas or anywhere else, you more than likely have damaged and/or loose roof shingles. To solve this problem, you will need to call a roofing expert to diagnose this problem and repair it by replacing the shingles.</p>
<p>If you suspect you have a leaky chimney, do not hesitate to <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/contact-us/" target="_blank">contact</a> Ashbusters today. We will find the leak and repair your problem quickly.</p>

<p>Having a chimney in your home is more than just having cozy warm nights with a rustic ambiance. It also entails a lot of responsibility and keen observational skills on your end, especially if you want to ensure your chimney’s functionality as well as your family’s safety.</p>
<p>More often than not, our team at <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/" target="_blank">Ashbusters Chimney Service</a> get approached by homeowners presenting concerns or asking certain things and issues about their chimneys. One of the most asked questions is regarding their chimney draft.</p>
<p><strong><em>So, here’s a short reference that has everything you would need to know about chimney drafts:</em></strong></p>
<h3>What is a chimney draft?</h3>
<p>The chimney draft, or simply called the draft, is the pulling action in your chimney caused by the negative pressure mechanism that’s at play inside each and every one of your chimneys. You see, your chimney produces hot air. When the heat generated inside the chimney reaches a certain level, it starts to pull air through the firebox, and thus, the draft.</p>
<h3>How will you be able to identify a draft problem?</h3>
<p>This is relatively easy to spot. All you need to watch out for are the 3 cardinal signs that are indicative of a chimney draft problem. First, you need to observe the air inside your home. If air begins to enter your home from your chimney, then that’s a sign that something is definitely wrong. Second, when you have unusual trying to start a fire or keep it burning, that’s another sign. And lastly, if you notice a smokey smell around your house even without a fire burning, then that’s definitely a warning sign.</p>
<h3>How does it affect us?</h3>
<p>Initially or in minute cases, draft problems don’t really pose that much of a threat to us. But according to the C<a href="http://www.csia.org/" target="_blank">himney Safety Institute of America</a>, in worst case scenarios it may turn your home into a risky living environment by becoming a fire and health hazard. Carbon monoxide poisoning can easily occur due to improper draft.</p>
<h3>What can we do?</h3>
<p>The best and smartest thing to do is to contact a <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/contact-us/" target="_blank">chimney expert</a> to check your chimney as soon as possible. Not only will they be able to point out damages and risks, but they would also help you in setting up preventive measure as to avoid dreadful and horrible scenarios from ever occurring.</p>
<p>Chimney draft problems are more common than you think. For all you know you have one going on in your home at this very moment. So what are you waiting for? Pick up the phone or open your computers and set an appointment as soon as you can.</p>

Make sure your chimney is always clean.</p></div>
<p>If you have a chimney, chances are you have had something stuck inside it at some point. A chimney blockage can be a dangerous situation; as stated by the <a href="http://www.csia.org/homeowner-resources/the_facts_about_chimney_fires.aspx" target="_blank">Chimney Safety Institute of America</a> (CSIA), a dirty chimney can cause a chimney fire. One of the main reasons an annual <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/services/sweeping/" target="_blank">chimney sweep</a> is so important, proper maintenance of your chimney prevents your chimney from blockages as everything is cleaned out and removed in the chimney sweep process. We at Ashbusters provide the best chimney sweep in town, and our CSIA-certified technicians will remove the following common chimney blockages when they are stuck in your chimney.</p>
<h3>Animals</h3>
<p>When the cold weather comes, animals like birds, squirrels, and raccoons come looking for a warm place to nest for the winter, and your chimney may become a chosen home. This can create a very perilous situation as not only could it cause a dangerous fire if you light a fire while the animal is inside your chimney, but if the animal becomes stuck, it could die, leaving it to spread foul, putrid fumes through your house. You should never try to remove a wild animal from a chimney yourself. Always call professionals like Ashbusters. We are <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/services/sweeping/" target="_blank">qualified</a> with removing animal debris, and if need be, we can contact a professional animal remover if an animal is still alive.</p>
<h3>Debris</h3>
<p>Even though you may have a chimney cap, leaves, trash, and settlement still seem to get into your chimney and accumulate. After a period of time, this accumulation can cause a blockage large enough to cause incomplete combustion and negative air pressure, driving smoke back into your house. Also, if you allow settlement to build up long enough, it causes cracks in your flue, and then you will have dangerous, poisonous carbon monoxide leaking into your house.</p>
<h3>Creosote</h3>
<p>If you have a wood-burning stove, you have creosote deposits building up on the walls of your chimney, and if you go too long without a chimney sweeping, creosote can build up large enough to be a hazardous blockage. According to the <a href="http://www.csia.org/homeowner-resources/the_facts_about_chimney_fires.aspx" target="_blank">CSIA</a>, creosote is formed naturally in the wood-burning process. When the by-products of combustion (smoke, vapors, tar fog, gases, hyrdocarbon, unburned wood particles, etc) exit your fireplace and go out your cooler chimney, condensation occurs, and the result is creosote residue. Black or brown in appearance, creosote can be sticky and tar-like, shiny and hardened, or crusty and flaky, but no matter what it looks like, it is a dangerous, highly-combustible compound that is the leading cause of chimney fires. Luckily, your annual <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/services/sweeping/" target="_blank">chimney sweep</a> will take care of all of the creosote build-up in your chimney. The CSIA-certified chimney sweeps at Ashbusters are highly trained to remove all creosote deposits from your chimney, making it safe from chimney fires.</p>
<p>Although, the “something is stuck in my chimney!” situation sounds dire and can be an emergency, there is a simple solution: <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/contact-us/" target="_blank">contact</a> Ashbusters today for a professional chimney sweep to get the blockage out of your chimney and safely enjoy your fireplace again.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A functional and high performing chimney is a fantastic addition to your home…especially during these cold months.

<div id="attachment_3195" style="width: 265px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/All-About-Carbon-Monoxide-Nashville-TN-Ashbusters-Chimney.jpg" class="highslide" onclick="return hs.expand(this)" ><img class="size-medium wp-image-3195" alt="Don't fall prey to this deadly gas.

Eliminate the risks of carbon monoxide poisoning by having regular inspections and being alert!</p></div>
<h3>What is Carbon Monoxide?</h3>
<p>Carbon Monoxide is an odorless, colorless gas that is extremely toxic. Once it enters the bloodstream, it begins to compete with the current oxygen levels. CO can be released into the air by using everyday appliances, such as generators, vehicles, and also your fireplace. If you are around one of these, make sure the area you are in is open. If the appliance has a vent, arrange where the fumes go outside. Lastly, never use something to heat your home that is not intended for that purpose, such as a gas oven, and do not leave other heating methods unattended or on overnight.</p>
<h3>How can you prevent carbon monoxide from getting in the air?</h3>
<p>Chimney draft is important when talking about carbon monoxide because if the draft cannot appropriately pull air through the home and out for the chimney, it will remain in the home. You can adjust the draft pressure by changing the heat of the fire or changing the physical structure of the chimney.</p>
<h3>Reasons draft is compromised</h3>
<p>Often times a draft’s flow can be disrupted. One of the most common and avoidable reasons is an abundance of creosote build up inside of the chimney. Creosotes are combustion particles released as firewood is burned that clump together as the make their way up the chimney. This is one of the reasons you should always make sure your chimney sweep is<a href="http://www.csia.org/homeowner-resources/how_to_hire_a_chimney_sweep.aspx" target="_blank"> Chimney Safety Institute of America</a> (CSIA) certified. CSIA has a list of set guidelines they use to ensure that you appointment is worth your time and will keep you safe. Other things that could cause draft problems include clogged dampers and dirty chimney caps.</p>
<h3>Other sources of potential trouble</h3>
<p>Other than draft problems, carbon monoxide can build up when other equipment is consuming the same clean air that is being vented within the house. If you use exhaust fans when you’re using a fuel-burning heater or stove, only run the fans for a few minutes at a time. Prolonged usage could remove too much air and waste heat. Also, do not run any power attic vents during the winter. When a fireplace or woodstove is running, open a window and turn off anything that releases warm air. You can also try replacing the air duct that connects to the fireplace so it does not steal air from your furnace.</p>
<h3>How can I protect my family?</h3>
<p>Now companies have invented CO alarms that you can install in your home to be alerted if levels in the area become dangerous. To get the best results, spread multiple alarms throughout the home, especially if there are multiple levels or an open floor plan. Some systems are built where you can connect them so that when one sounds they all go off. These alarms should be used with smoke detectors, not instead of, and should be tested periodically.</p>
<h3>What does CO poisoning feel like and how is it treated?</h3>
<p>Because of the state of carbon monoxide, people cannot tell when it begins to fill a room. This is detrimental to a person’s health because they will intake more than their body can handle before they even realize it. There are differing levels of symptoms you can have depending on how much of the gas you take in. Mild symptoms are flulike and include nausea, dizziness, headache, and fatigue, while the more severe symptoms can lead to fatality. If someone in your home has a medical condition they may react differently or more quickly, while people with heart and breathing conditions will begin to experience chest pain.</p>
<p>If you or the people around you begin to feel these symptoms, you should evacuate the area immediately, even if you cannot get to whatever is releasing the gas to turn it off. You should also seek immediate medical attention. Patients who have had minimal exposure should be able to be treated in office, but in extreme cases they may have to be admitted into a hospital to receive oxygen to normalize levels.</p>
<p>If you have any additional questions about the risks of carbon monoxide or want to schedule your annual chimney inspection, <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/contact-us/" target="_blank">call us today</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes it is amazing how we scrutinize the littlest of things and then treat something such as a chimney cleaning so casual. Many homeowners do not realize that not just anyone should be entering their home to clean their chimney. In fact, homeowners should take special precaution to ensure that <a href="http://www.ncsg.org/NCSG-Member/Ashbusters-Chimney-Service-Inc" target="_blank">only NCSG member sweeps</a> are doing the cleaning.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2274" title="National Chimney Sweep Guild" alt="National Chimney Sweep Guild" src="http://www.ashbusters.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/ashbusters-ncsg-logo.png" width="210" height="90" /></p>
<p>The National Chimney Sweep Guild, or NCSG, in an organization started over three decades ago with less than two dozen members. Today, it is the standard for all chimney sweeps. It is a true educational source for homeowners and chimney sweeps alike. In fact, the organization conducts various seminars and classes specifically to prepare sweeps for the membership exam.</p>
<p>In addition to the NCSG, homeowners should also look for sweeps that are certified from the Chimney Safety Institute of America, or CSIA. This organization provides a code of ethics by which all chimney sweeps must abide. This code provides the thousands of homeowners employing their services every year significant peace of mind.</p>
<p>These two programs together have literally created the industry standard for chimney sweeps. When inquiring with different companies, tell the agent specifically that you are requesting member chimney sweeps and that they have their credentials readily available for your inspection. This will also serve to let the company know you are aware of the membership process as well as the code of ethics sweeps are expected to follow.</p>
<p>When looking for certified chimney sweeps, homeowners can use both the CSIA website (www.csia.org) and the NCSG website (www.ncsg.org) to find certified and member companies. If there was ever a time to avoid taking the short cut and using personal ad sites to find a service provider, this is it! You family&#8217;s safety and that of your home are far too important to trust to some random individual.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You love your fireplace, but do you know how to tell if it is working properly. It may seem like a complicated operation, but the basic physics of how a fireplace and chimney work are relatively easy to understand. Here are some quick tips so you will be able to tell if your fireplace and chimney are working safely and properly when in operation.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2248" title="Ashbusters Chimney - How Your Chimney Works" alt="Ashbusters Chimney - How Your Chimney Works" src="http://www.ashbusters.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/ashbusters-how-your-chimney-works-200x300.jpg" width="200" height="300" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Think of your home as a flow system, where air enters in the bottom and escapes through the top. The airflow of the home is influenced by a variety of factors, including the operation of your fireplace.</li>
<li>When warm air is created, it rises in the home. This is sometimes referred to as the &#8220;stack effect.&#8221; This warm air is trying to escape in any way it can, be it a chimney or crack in the window molding. While this air is trying to escape, colder air is trying to get in. The <a href="http://www.healthyhouseinstitute.com/smallpedia.php?id=623" target="_blank">Neutral Pressure Plane</a>, or NPP, establishes itself somewhere in the home dictating the point where air begins to escape and enter. The areas below the NPP are entry points and the areas above the NPP are exit points.</li>
<li>Wind will also affect the operation of your chimney. When wind hits a building, this causes a high-pressure build up. Downwind, the side of the home away from the wind strike, experiences a low pressure. If there is an opening on the downwind side of the home, it will depressurize the home and can cause a backdraft in the fireplace or chimney, thus resulting in smoke coming into the home.</li>
<li>Other mechanical devices in the home will also affect the performance of your chimney. Appliances and such creating a vacuum or forcing air can make it very difficult for the chimney to perform properly as they are changing the natural flow of air in the home.</li>
<li>Airflow can be restricted in your chimney as well from a lack of preventative maintenance. For example, a wood burning fireplace may experience excessive creosote buildup, leaving a smaller area for the smoke to flow. In addition, this is a major fire hazard. This flow can also be interrupted due to dirty or obstructed dampers, screens, and chimney caps.</li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every year, there are literally thousands of needless deaths caused by building fires. Sadly, many of these deaths are preventable with proper care and preventative maintenance in place. Creosote buildup is one of the major causes of home fires, and is something which every homeowner with a fireplace needs to be aware.</p>
<p>Creosote is a residue created from burning fires. It will appear as a gooey buildup and is extremely flammable. If this substance accumulates in the fireplace or chimney, the home is more susceptible to an accidental fire. As little as 1/8&#8243; of buildup is more than enough to cause a chimney fire. Fires of this nature often spread very quickly, and cannot be extinguished easily with home fire safety devices, such as a fire extinguisher. It is for this reason that preventative maintenance should be scheduled.</p>
<p>It is recommended that a fireplace safety inspection be conducted every year. Ideally, this inspection will take place at the end of the summer or early fall before the fireplace is put to use again. What many homeowners do not realize is that even though the fireplace is not in use, it serves as an exhaust for the home. In addition, there is the chance of buildup from outside sources. This can serve as an additional accelerant, and make it even more likely that a fire will occur.</p>
<p>While there are some products that can be purchased, it is recommended that a professional chimney sweep conduct both the inspection and the cleaning process. The average homeowner does not have the expertise or experience to ensure their chimney is indeed cleaned and safe to use. If there is ever an area where it is better to be safe than sorry, a fireplace and chimney free of creosote buildup is it!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Having a nice, warm, and cozy fireplace where you can relax and snuggle with your loved ones is the perfect thing to come home to from a long, cold, and tiring day. Our fireplaces have indeed given us that sense of relief and comfort. But sometimes we fail to take care of the things that give us pleasure. Just like the simple task of <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/services/sweeping/">cleaning and maintaining our fireplaces and chimneys</a>. We should never take this for granted because as they bring much satisfaction and enjoyment, they could also bring a great deal of danger to our homes and our lives if they are not properly maintained.</p>
<p>There are many harmful things that spring from a poorly cleaned chimney. Smoke can easily circulate in the house instead of exiting the chimney which can suffocate the people inside.  Also, a chimney fire could get out of control, and burn down the roof, ceiling, attic, or even the entire house. One reason for chimney fires is the substance called creosote. This tar-like substance is formed from smoke, gases, vapor, minerals, volatile hydrocarbon, and other particles that are supposed to escape through the chimney flue. But due to the cooler temperature of the chimney walls, it causes a reaction called condensation to occur which transforms these particles into creosote. Instead of freely going out of the chimney, they stick to the chimney flue’s walls. What’s very dangerous about it is that it is extremely combustible. Too much build-up of this in the chimney flue can easily start a chimney fire and can even explode in severe cases.</p>
<p>Factors such as the chimney’s cooler temperature, restricted air supply, and burning unseasoned wood can greatly increase the production of creosote. This is why regular chimney sweeping should be done. It should be free of creosote build-up. The surest way to prevent accidents from ever occurring is by taking care of your fireplace and your chimneys. It’s just a small price to pay considering all the comfort and joy it brings.</p>
