				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One subject you hear us talk a lot about is dryer vent cleaning. It may be the single most important thing you can do to prevent fire to your home. Of course there are other needs when it comes to fire prevention. Things like not overloading your electrical outlets and having your chimney swept come to mind. Nonetheless, the high flammability of lint makes regular cleaning of your dryer vent imperative.</p>
<p>Lint is made up of the loose fibers that come from your clothes during the drying process. These fibers, no longer in a dense environment, burn much quicker. Once the lint starts to build up inside the lint trap of the dryer and the vent that leads outdoors, you will start to see your clothes take longer to dry in the machine. This is a major clue that your vents need to be cleaned very soon. Once too much lint is present, then the hot air from the dryer cannot escape, and the buildup will cause a fire.</p>
<p>Once you have cleaned your dryer vent and lint trap, don&#8217;t forget that your lint can actually be used for other things.</p>
<ul>
<li>Kindling &#8211; You can use lint&#8217;s flammability to your advantage.</li>
<li>Pet Bedding &#8211; Do you have a pet like a hamster or guineau pig? The lint can be used as bedding for your little buddy.</li>
<li>Mulch &#8211; This will work if you wear organic or natural clothing.</li>
<li>Make Clay &#8211; <a href="http://www.thriftyfun.com/tf184073.tip.html" target="_blank">Here</a> is a recipe for making clay out of your lint.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, you see? There are multiple good reasons for you to regularly clean your dryer lint.
