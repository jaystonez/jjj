				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To safely ignite <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/catalog/fireplaces-and-stoves/contemporary-gas-fireplaces/">your gas fireplace</a>, follow this series of easy to remember steps.</p>
<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2526" alt="Safely igniting your gas fireplace" src="http://www.ashbusters.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/ashbusters-safely-igniting-gas-fireplace-300x207.png" width="300" height="207" />
<ul>
<li>Check to be sure the damper is open to your venting. Gas logs give off a great deal of carbon monoxide, so adequate venting is essential. The damper can be partially closed later on to prevent excessive heat loss but, obviously, smoke needs to be drawn up the chimney and out of the house.</li>
<li>Start the flow of gas to your fireplace appliance. There is usually a gas supply valve inside the glass doors of the fireplace. This connects the fireplace to the gas line. Turn the valve on or to its open position to admit gas to the fireplace pipe.</li>
<li>Check to be sure the pilot light is lit. If it is not, this needs to be corrected first. Generally, there is a knob that has to be turned counter-clockwise to the pilot position. Release the knob. There is also usually a button that you need to press to send gas to the pilot. Press the button for a full minute, or until an igniter sparks a flame. The igniter may have to be clicked several times.</li>
<li>Once the pilot has been lit, it will ignite gas sent to the logs. After inserting the key into the keyhole at the front of the fireplace, turn it clockwise. You should be able to hear gas flowing to the fireplace. With either a match or a grill lighter, light the fire. The fireplace may also be equipped with a red ignition button.</li>
<li>The safest practice is to turn out the pilot light and stop the flow of gas to the fireplace altogether when it is not in use. This entails shutting the gas supply valve as well, completely stopping the passage of gas into the fireplace pipe.</li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One big thing for homeowners to think about is which type of fireplace do they want. Now this decision can come as they are shopping for a new home, but it can also come when they are thinking about a home remodeling project. It is important to remember that adding a fireplace does not necessarily mean having to have major structural changes to your home. Of course, structural changes are a possibility. It all depends on the choices you make.</p>
<p>One very popular form of fireplace installation is a direct vent gas fireplace. They provide a very efficient way of heating the home, and help homeowners avoid the mess of a traditional wood fireplace. These are powered by either propane or natural gas. You can also get ventless fireplaces that use natural gas or propane, but we do not recommend them. The chance of Carbon Monoxide poisoning is too great.</p>
<p>Electric fireplaces and Pellet stoves are additional types of fireplace appliances. Electric fireplaces are useful for some people, but they have to keep in mind that this type of fireplace can cost you more than a gas alternative. Plus, if you ever experience a power outage, the fireplace is not going to work. Pellet stoves can be a useful alternative to having an insert. Plus, they are probably cheaper in regards to home modifications.</p>
<p>Finally, there is always the good old wood stove and chimney choice. While you may not want to spend the money to add one to an existing home, most new home constructions give you the choice of what you want to do. Many will even let you choose between gas and wood burning. Whatever type of fireplace or stove you are thinking about, make sure you research the various safety precautions that go along with that choice. You want to make sure you are prepared to do whatever is safest for you and your family.</p>
