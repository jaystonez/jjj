				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You have the responsibility of taking care of your chimney. You should be aware of the different things that need to be done on a regular basis to operate it properly. There are several ways to maintain your chimney, and one of these is to consult with a professional in the field. You are going to find that a lot of people will pass themselves off as chimney professionals, but they do not have the proper credentials. Their usual tactic is to pass themselves off as experts in chimneys, but in fact they are not. They do not have the same training and credentials that real professionals have. According to some reports, they will enter your home, and begin to act like a chimney inspector. They will even appear to be checking the chimney. They will tell you about many problems regarding the chimney. They will say that the chimney is in a very severe condition, and that it needs a lot of repairs. However, there is usually little to no damage actually present. They will request a lot of money to be used in the replacement of the different parts of your chimney. These con-men are all around the place these days. They knock on your door, and it can be difficult toÂ  tell which ones are legitimate and which ones are not.</p>
<p>To avoid this, try consulting with a variety of sweeps in the area. Get recommendations from your neighbors about who they use for their chimney related needs. Also, you can also consult with local government agencies. One particularly great indicator of a competent chimney sweep is a <a href="http://www.csia.org/" target="_blank">Chimney Institute of America (CSIA) certification</a>. This will be the safest choice when you want your chimney to be inspected. Remember, you are the one who calls the chimney sweep. It is not normal or ethical for chimney sweeps to go door to door offering their services. Use your head, and you will no doubt avoid these common and dangerous scams.</p>
