				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are a few sets of circumstances under which a chimney liner may need to be replaced. For example:</p>
<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2817" title="Replace Chimney Flue - Nashville TN - Ashbusters Chimney Service" alt="Replace Chimney Flue - Nashville TN - Ashbusters Chimney Service" src="http://www.ashbusters.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/ashbusters-replacing-chimney-flue-300x199.jpg" width="300" height="199" />
<ul>
<li>the liner has warped or cracked</li>
<li>there is a major problem with creosote accumulation</li>
<li>the flue is the wrong size for the fireplace</li>
</ul>
<p>These conditions, among other possible causes of necessary replacement, all call for a professional to come <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/services/chimney-repairs/chimney-relining/">replace the liner</a>.</p>
<p><b>Don’t Blame Yourself</b></p>
<p>Metal flues can be warped by excessive heat produced with fires built too high. Who has not kept adding logs to a warm fire on a brutally cold winter night to suddenly realize, oops, that is a really big fire? Even good quality flue tiles can crack when exposed to temperature extremes or shifted by settling foundations.</p>
<p>Creosote deposits can seep through cracks in mortar joints, getting behind the liner and making your clearances truly void. Re-heated and re-formed every time you use the fireplace, those easily ignited creosote deposits are no longer confined to the inside of the liner. Little sparks have access to the actual structure of your house, which is completely unacceptable.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, the flue can be the wrong size for the fireplace, just as a chimney can be the wrong height. That is a little mind-boggling, since one would expect all of that to have been considered when the fireplace system was first installed. Still, improperly sized or improperly installed flues are among the primary causes of an inadequate updraft.</p>
<p><b>Just Do The Right Thing</b></p>
<p>Whatever caused it, a warped or cracked chimney liner has to be replaced, and so does one with <a href="http://www.msue.msu.edu/objects/content_revision/download.cfm/revision_id.499664/workspace_id.-4/01500598.html/" target="_blank">excess creosote buildup</a>. If Stage 3 creosotes are present on the inside, their extremely difficult removal makes liner replacement preferable. If even less developed creosotes are on the outside of the liner, you can forget the liner you have got and start choosing another.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Less expensive to install and easier to care for, factory built fireplaces are attracting more and more homeowners. Decidedly more efficient than traditional fireplaces, <a href="http://www.wisegeek.com/what-are-flue-kits.htm" target="_blank">factory built systems</a> present standard options that can give a home fireplace a custom look as well. Factory built fireplaces powered by electricity or gas that require venting still do a better job of safely retaining heat, and ventless versions can eliminate the need for a chimney altogether.</p>
<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2806" title="Pre-fab fireplace - Nashville TN - Ashbusters Chimney Service" alt="Pre-fab fireplace - Nashville TN - Ashbusters Chimney Service" src="http://www.ashbusters.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/ashbusters-B41XT.jpeg" width="233" height="196" />
<p><strong>Metal Flues and Fireboxes Shine In Several Ways</strong></p>
<p>Factory built flues for vented fireplaces are of much better quality now than they used to be, when inferior materials resulted in warping. These days, continuous metal flue liners are available with the strength of stainless steel, making them more durable and easier to care for. More resistant to both creosote buildup and penetration by water than other chimney liners, the metal flues of factory built fireplaces shine in many regards.</p>
<p>The metal fireboxes that comprise the base of a factory built system offer energy savings for both homeowners and the planet. Made from steel or cast iron, they naturally retain heat within their own walls and, closed with decorative doors, permit less loss of heat already in the house. Blowers send that heat back into the room so, even though factory built systems are not intended to handle high temperatures, they can generate more heat.</p>
<p><strong>Factory Built Fireplaces Are Hot for Good Reason</strong></p>
<p>Ventless factory built fireplaces come without any need for a flue and, typically fed by either natural gas or electricity, are extremely convenient. Nothing more than turning a knob and pressing a switch are required to have the pretty flicks of an apparent fire behind glowing glass doors.</p>
<p>More affordable, more efficient, and more trouble-free in every way, factory built fireplaces are gaining in popularity for obvious reasons. Definitely worth discussing with a fireplace professional, <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/catalog/fireplaces-and-stoves/">factory built fireplace systems</a> offer exactly the right choice for many homeowners. With regular cleanings and routine inspections, both vented and ventless factory built fireplaces are easy to care for and deserve to be hot items.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chimneys are natural sources of drafts because they are gaping holes that emit and pull in air. Anyone who owns a wood burning appliance should understand the concept of draft. Air moving up a chimney follows the same physical principles as does water flowing in a hose. Addressing chimney draft issues enables the fireplace and chimney to operate in peak condition.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2301" title="Dealing with chimney draft problems" alt="Dealing with chimney draft problems" src="http://www.ashbusters.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/ashbusters-chimney-draft-problems-300x239.jpg" width="300" height="239" /></p>
<p>When the fireplace chimney is filled with hot air, additional air is pulled through the firebox in a process called draft. A chimney is an example of a negative pressure system because air pressure is negative. Increasing the chimney draft is similar to opening a water faucet connected to a hose. By burning a fire hotter, lighter air is created, increasing the draft in the chimney through increased pull. Increasing the chimney height will also provide more draft.</p>
<p>Given the same amount of draft, a flue that is larger will exhaust more smoke from a fireplace. However, just as a water hose may become plugged, chimney airflow may be restricted by several conditions, slowing the flow of smoke up the chimney. A closed or improperly operating damper, excessive deposits of creosote, or dirty chimney cap can create poor air flow within a chimney.</p>
<p>An improperly constructed chimney or structural damage to the area can also prevent the maximum amount of smoke from being exhausted from the fireplace. In some cases, smoke may be emitted backwards, ending up in the home. This forces occupants to breathe the contained chemicals and impurities, which is a health hazard.</p>
<p>A chimney sweep can <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/services/inspections/">inspect the chimney</a> to identify whether the proper amount of draft and air flow are occurring. If creosote has built up or something is obstructing the air flow, the sweep will remove it by cleaning the chimney. Structural issues can be addressed by chimney repair or in the most severe cases, replacement.</p>
