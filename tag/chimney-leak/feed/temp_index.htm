				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many houses have problems with their chimneys that turn out to be water leakage. Evidence for this problem includes water running down the flue, water running down the brickwork in the attic or inside the house, or the exposed chimney gets damp and deposits of white lime form on the outside of the brick. If you think your roof is having leaking problems, and you can&#8217;t find the problem, scrutinize your chimney as well. If the signs were ignored, water can profusely leak inside your house, and can cause great damage to your property.</p>
<p>How to fix your leaking chimney:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check each part of the chimney, both inside and outside of the home. Evidence of water is easily detected inside the house through stains or swollen walls. Look carefully to see more signs of leaking water. Check the exterior chimney of all its parts. Check the chimney cap if it has cracks or is dislodging.</li>
<li>Inspect the mortar and flashing. Spalled brick and missing mortar can cause water leakage as well. Check the flashing to see if it is properly installed. The chimney flashing is the part that connects the chimney to the roof. Look to see if it is inadequate, corroded or worn.</li>
<li>A chimney that is cracked can be replaced with new materials or repaired. In replacing the cap, make sure to put a waterproof covering on the surface of the cap.</li>
<li>If your chimney is the masonry type, cover all surfaces with a waterproof coating. Apply waterproof material with commercial quality to avoid wasting time and money.</li>
<li>If the problem is the flashing, hire a professional chimney expert to do the job.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are not sure of the things that you see, hire a chimney professional to inspect them. Fires can be prevented by having someone with a knowledgeable eye look at the problem.</p>
