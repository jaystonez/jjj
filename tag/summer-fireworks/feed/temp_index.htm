				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every year more and more people are looking forward to celebrate their summer vacations where there is lots of camping, swimming, out-of-town trips, picnics, and family reunions. However, summertime is also an important time for fire prevention, because many fire incidents and injuries happen during this time. Every year approximately 8,600 Americans are injured due to incidents of fire caused by wood burning, charcoal, and propane grilling. In the year 2010, 73% of injuries caused by fireworks happened in between June 18 â€“ July 18.</p>
<p>Family camping is also widespread during summer months. It is necessary to follow the rules of the park or other theme areas when making camp fires. Summer is the time to enjoy and relax, and following some simple fire safety tips will help you have a memorable summer experience.</p>
<ul>
<li>As much as possible, do not use fireworks at home. You can watch fireworks displays at parks where you can enjoy their beauty more safely. In fact, towns and cities all over Middle Tennessee put on their own fireworks displays. If you do use them at home, do not light them inside the house or near gas tanks. Always make sure that there is water readily available in case of fire, and ensure that fire extinguishers are working. Do not stand close to the fireworks, and do not wear loose clothing in order to prevent fire from reaching your clothes. Make sure that there are no children near the fireworks, and do not allow them to handle the fireworks.</li>
<li>When barbeque grilling, make sure that the propane gas and the fuel line are properly connected. Ensure that the tubes are not blocked, and do not fill the propane tank to the fullest. Take safety precautions when using lighter fluid, and never add it to a grill that is already lit. Keep the lighters and matches away from the fire, and dispose of the coal properly. Do not grill in an enclosed area, because the smoke will emit poisonous carbon monoxide.</li>
<li>During campfires, build the fire in an area far from grass and other plants so that the fire will not spread. Keep the fire small so it will be easier to extinguish. Do not leave the fire unattended, and always have water ready in case the fire starts to get too big.</li>
</ul>
