				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When you consider that there are over 40 dryer fires in the US alone each and every day, then you must consider a product that is known to warn you of danger ahead of time. We care because we know this device will save lives. It does all this by monitoring the dryer exhaust system for any issues that might appear as lint builds up over time.</p>
<p>You will be able to follow the LintAlert® by watching a series of LED lights that indicate how your dryer is functioning. If the airflow becomes restricted and dangerous an alarm is sounded to alert you of a potential fire hazard.</p>
<p>When a dryer is struggling to dry clothes, this is an indication that there is an exhaust issue of some sort. Of course, it will eventually show up on the utility bills. What you don’t see is how the combination of excess lint trapped with the hot air that has no where to go can easily catch fire in your home. The number one reason is operational deficiency, including failure to clean!</p>
<p>Because clothes dryers account for over <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/2007_us_fire_admin.pdf" target="_blank">15,000 structure fires</a>, 15 deaths and 400 injuries annually we have decided to not only recommend LintAlert®,  but to also have it available for our customers. Ashbusters believes in maintenance and cleaning for chimneys and dryers and doing everything possible to eliminate any potential fire in your home.  We also know that taking the necessary steps toward safety will give you the peace of mind you and your family deserve. Using LintAlert® as instructed and recommended will give you that peace of mind as well as helps you keep your dryer in tip top shape for fire safety. It will also keep your utility bills as low as possible.</p>
<p>If you have any questions in regard to the LintAlert® or would like to ask any additional questions, don’t hesitate to <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/contact-us/">contact Ashbusters.net</a>.</p>
