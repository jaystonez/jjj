				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We offer a variety of products for home owners and their chimneys. One of our favorites, however, is <a title="HeatShield" href="http://www.ashbusters.net/services/heatshield/">HeatShield®</a> by CeCURE Chimney Systems. This innovative product can save you from having to install a stainless steel chimney liner. Gaps and cracks are simply a part of owning a chimney built of mortar. There are a variety of fixes for this, including a total rebuild of the chimney. However, if it is appropriate for your situation, we love recommending HeatShield®.</p>
<p>For a long time, stainless steel liners were the only viable option for relining a chimney whose clay liner had cracked or become damaged. Now you can fully restore that clay liner, and avoid an expensive rebuild or stainless steel insert. Here are just some of the chimney conditions that cause dangerous situations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deteriorated mortar between clay flue liners</li>
<li>Cracked clay liners</li>
<li>Spalled clay flue liners or tiles (flaking)</li>
<li>Eroded clay liner</li>
<li>Gaps and holes between flue tiles</li>
<li>Cracked flue tiles</li>
</ul>
<p>Another reason we offer this type of relining solution is because customers may have a tendency to avoid taking care of a damaged chimney if it isn&#8217;t cost effective. We want to offer something that will compel them to act, because a damaged chimney is not just inefficient, but it is also dangerous. One of the leading causes of chimney fires is a cracked chimney. In fact, the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) states,“If the flue liner in a chimney has softened, cracked or otherwise deteriorated so that it no longer has the ability to contain the products of combustion (i.e., heat, moisture, creosote, and flue gases), it shall be removed and replaced, repaired or relined…” NFPA 211-Standard for Chimneys, Fireplaces, Vents and Solid Fuel-Burning Appliances (2006).</p>
<p>So, don&#8217;t wait any longer to have your chimney repaired. It isn&#8217;t just a cost consideration. It is very much a safety consideration. Please feel free to <a title="Contact Us" href="http://www.ashbusters.net/contact-us/">contact us</a> with any questions, and we will be glad to help.</p>
