<p>Failing to prepare your fireplace and chimney for the conditions to which they will be subjected is surely preparing them to fail under said conditions.  If chimney maintenance isn’t at or near the top of your to do list, it should be!</p>
<p>We really put our chimney systems through the wringer during the heating season; we owe it to them to have a thorough, annual <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/services/inspections/">inspection</a> conducted after periods of heavy use so as to provide additional peace of mind that all things are as they should be.  We encourage you to use the information provided herein and pass it along to your neighbors, friends and family.</p>
<p><strong>Water is the enemy!</strong></p>
<p>Not waterproofing a chimney opens the door to a multitude of problems.  On the other hand, making the choice to waterproof your chimney enables it to repel up to 99.9% of water that could otherwise penetrate and harm all of your chimney system’s components.</p>
<p>The materials used to build most masonry chimneys experience hastened deterioration as a result of prolonged exposure to and contact with water.  The freezing and thawing process — during which time water that has penetrated the various chimney materials freezes and expands — quickly deteriorates the overall construction of your chimney.  Water in your chimney can also cause rust on steel and cast iron parts, ultimately weakening or destroying them.</p>
<p>Your chimney’s exterior is constantly battered by the weather.  Harsh weather conditions can have a negative effect on your chimney.  In addition, when water mixes with the creosote that is often present in a wood-burning fireplace, it will generate an extremely unpleasant odor that can fill your entire home.  All of these things combined greatly compromise the overall structure of your chimney.</p>
<p><strong>Chimney sweeping is a must!</strong></p>
<p>Basking in the warmth of a roaring fire during the colder months is like a rite of passage for many.  Winter isn’t complete unless there’s a fire burning in the fireplace.  Much preparation goes into making this a reality.  If you don’t put some thought into it before you light your winter fires, your enjoyment could very well be short-lived.</p>
<p>Dirty chimneys can cause chimney fires, which damage structures, destroy homes and injure or kill people; it can also lead to carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning which can harm or kill people as well.  Creosote becomes dangerous when it’s allowed to accumulate in your chimney.  Although the buildup cannot be avoided completely, burning small, hot fires and using dry, seasoned wood can minimize the buildup.</p>
<p>Sooner or later, every chimney needs to be cleaned to remove creosote buildup.  It’s highly recommended that you leave this task to a CSIA-certified chimney sweep.  The frequency for your cleanings will vary based on the amount of use your fireplace receives, but it should never be any longer than a year between cleanings, as the likelihood of a clean chimney catching fire or producing deadly levels of CO is far less than a dirty one.</p>
<p>When you go too long without keeping up with those critical items on your honey do list, you can find yourself creating bigger home repair expenses for yourself.  As many homeowners can attest, small problems can become big problems when routine maintenance is neglected.</p>
<p>The best way to maintain a fully functioning and safe chimney system is to hire CSIA-certified chimney pros like Ashbusters to ensure your maintenance is done right the first time, every time.  We know we’re not the only chimney service in town; however, we believe we are the best and would greatly appreciate it if you would give us the opportunity to prove it!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Important Functions of the Chimney Safety Institute of America</strong></p>
<p>Many homeowners do not have many questions about their chimneys and fireplaces. They assume that they will always work properly and safely. Then, when there is an issue, they are not sure where to turn. Helping people in this situation is just one of the important functions of the Chimney Safety Institute of America.</p>
<p>The primary function of the Chimney Safety Institute of America is to train qualified chimney sweeps and technicians. They provide a variety of training programs that teach these people the ins and outs of chimney maintenance. In the end, they provide the certification that lets consumers know they are dealing with someone who truly knows what they are doing. In fact, it is advisable that homeowners only use chimney technicians who have been trained and certified by The Chimney Safety Institute of America &#8211; as <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/about-us/" target="_blank">all of us are at Ashbusters</a>.</p>
<div id="attachment_3123" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Trust-the-CSIA-Nashville-TN-Ashbusters.jpg" class="highslide" onclick="return hs.expand(this)" ><img class="size-medium wp-image-3123" alt="The Chimney Safety Institute of America not only trains and certifies sweeps, it provides a plethora of information for homeowners. " src="http://www.ashbusters.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Trust-the-CSIA-Nashville-TN-Ashbusters-300x207.jpg" width="300" height="207" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The Chimney Safety Institute of America not only trains and certifies sweeps, it provides a plethora of information for homeowners.</p></div>
<p>Like any industry, there are always new developments in terms of chimney and fireplace maintenance. In order to provide the best service, chimney professionals must stay on top of all new technologies and techniques. The CSIA, in addition to providing initial training and certification, provides courses that help experiences professionals stay at the head of their field. They can take these classes in person or online, making it easy for any technician to be the best they can be.</p>
<p>Sometimes, a homeowner just has a simply question about their chimney or fireplace. The problem with searching the Internet for information is that it is hard to tell which resources are truly reliable. The <a href="http://www.csia.org/" target="_blank">CSIA&#8217;s website</a> has a number of resources for homeowners that provide a great deal of reliable information. Homeowners do not need to spend hours searching online for information that may or may not be correct. They can go to one place and find information that they can trust.</p>
<p>In some cases, reading a simple article does not help solve the problem. In that case, it may be necessary to bring in a professional. Homeowners can visit its website to find a certified professional in their area. The simple search tool makes it easy to find someone who was trained by the Chimney Safety Institute of American in close proximity to the home. This eliminates the need to spend time and money on someone who does not really know what they are doing and may actually cause more damage.</p>
<p>What many people do not realize is that it also provides these services for dryer vent issues. In addition to training chimney sweeps, its trains and certifies professionals who deal with dryer vents. A homeowner who is having trouble with their dryer can find useful information on the website to help solve the problem.</p>
<p>Many people do not give much though to their chimneys and dryer vents until they have a problem. When they do, though, they often turn to The Chimney Safety Institute of America for assistance. This organization provides valuable resources for homeowners. Most importantly, however, they train professionals who are able to handle the most complicated of issues.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Cleaning Your Industrial Chimneys</b></p>
<p>Industrial chimneys, often called smokestacks, provided the impetus for modern chimney sweeping. It was during the Industrial Revolution that smokestacks appeared and smaller home chimneys began to spread. Small boys were sent up them to clean out the soot and creosote, and constant exposure to toxic materials caused cancers, serious injuries, and deaths.</p>
<div id="attachment_2921" style="width: 228px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Chimney_sweep_modern-w800-h600.jpg" class="highslide" onclick="return hs.expand(this)" ><img class="size-medium wp-image-2921" alt="Modern Chimney Inspection - Nashville TN - Ashbusters" src="http://www.ashbusters.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Chimney_sweep_modern-w800-h600-218x300.jpg" width="218" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Modern Chimney Inspection &#8211; Nashville TN &#8211; Ashbusters</p></div>
<p>Slowly – and thankfully – laws and codes were written to protect these vulnerable children. Comparatively quickly, the reason for those laws and codes changed from protection of little sweeps to the safeguarding of those beneath the chimney. The modern chimney sweep industry exists to facilitate the inspections necessary for confirmation that the chimney may be safely used.</p>
<p><b>Safety First</b></p>
<p>Since there are typically many more people to protect under an “industrial chimney” than one above a single-family home, the first needs much more attention. Smokestacks get far more use, and “scrubbers” and “screens” that protect the environment do it by allowing fewer by-products of combustion out of the chimney. The potential for an explosive chimney fire is definitely present, and the safety of the workplace should be paramount.</p>
<p>In the past, there was at least some excuse for not cleaning smokestacks frequently enough, since it required taking them out of use. That is no longer the case because chimney sweeps with CSIA <a href="http://www.csia.org/" target="_blank">certification</a> can inspect your smokestack ‘remotely’ while it is “on line”. Fittingly called “hot camera inspections”, they allow properly trained chimney sweeps to conduct an informative check of the flue while it is in use.</p>
<p><b>Online Services</b></p>
<p>Combined with other technologies developed to facilitate less disruptive inspection of industrial chimneys, on-line assessments of smokestack conditions leave no excuse for compromising workplace safety. Your employees are counting on you for that, and your local governments are insisting on it. With the ease of having your industrial chimney inspected without a disruption to workflow, a certified chimney sweep can assist you making sure you are in compliance.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes it is amazing how we scrutinize the littlest of things and then treat something such as a chimney cleaning so casual. Many homeowners do not realize that not just anyone should be entering their home to clean their chimney. In fact, homeowners should take special precaution to ensure that <a href="http://www.ncsg.org/NCSG-Member/Ashbusters-Chimney-Service-Inc" target="_blank">only NCSG member sweeps</a> are doing the cleaning.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2274" title="National Chimney Sweep Guild" alt="National Chimney Sweep Guild" src="http://www.ashbusters.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/ashbusters-ncsg-logo.png" width="210" height="90" /></p>
<p>The National Chimney Sweep Guild, or NCSG, in an organization started over three decades ago with less than two dozen members. Today, it is the standard for all chimney sweeps. It is a true educational source for homeowners and chimney sweeps alike. In fact, the organization conducts various seminars and classes specifically to prepare sweeps for the membership exam.</p>
<p>In addition to the NCSG, homeowners should also look for sweeps that are certified from the Chimney Safety Institute of America, or CSIA. This organization provides a code of ethics by which all chimney sweeps must abide. This code provides the thousands of homeowners employing their services every year significant peace of mind.</p>
<p>These two programs together have literally created the industry standard for chimney sweeps. When inquiring with different companies, tell the agent specifically that you are requesting member chimney sweeps and that they have their credentials readily available for your inspection. This will also serve to let the company know you are aware of the membership process as well as the code of ethics sweeps are expected to follow.</p>
<p>When looking for certified chimney sweeps, homeowners can use both the CSIA website (www.csia.org) and the NCSG website (www.ncsg.org) to find certified and member companies. If there was ever a time to avoid taking the short cut and using personal ad sites to find a service provider, this is it! You family&#8217;s safety and that of your home are far too important to trust to some random individual.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chimney cleanliness is very important to the health, warmth, and safety of your home. A <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/services/inspections/" target="_blank">quality chimney inspection</a> can save you money and alert you to any possible problems your chimney may have that could result in a dangerous situation. The Chimney Safety Institute of America recommends using a CSIA Certified Chimney Sweep who will adhere to the three levels of inspection as put into code by the National Fire Protection Association. A Level Three inspection is the absolute best inspection as it covers all areas of chimney use and any possible changes that have or will be made to your chimney system. A solid chimney inspection will provide you with the peace of mind necessary to enjoy your chimney.</p>
<p>Chimney inspections are very important. Even if you don&#8217;t use your chimney that often a proper chimney inspection is crucial to anyone who owns a property with a chimney in order to keep your house and family safe. Chimney inspections ensure the proper care and maintenance of the chimney unit and can serve as a warning if there are any significant problems in your chimney of which you aren&#8217;t currently aware. It&#8217;s easy to locate a CSIA Certified Chimney Sweep in your area. Just go to <a href="http://www.csia.org/" target="_blank">www.csia.org</a> and click on the “Homeowner Resources” tab at the top of the page. A drop down menu will appear. Choose the last tab, “Locate a CSIA Certified Professional” and click on it. You will see a page that allows you to place as much information as you choose and once complete, click the “Search” button on the page and a list of certified technicians will appear. These chimney professional are considered some of the best in your area. The importance of a good chimney inspection must be taken seriously to make sure your chimney is working safely and soundly so hire the best you can find for the job.</p>
<p>A chimney inspection will cause no damage to your chimney unit. Some tools may be used to obtain access and remove panels and coverings. However, during a proper chimney inspection your home and chimney unit will not sustain any scratching or structural damage to the finish or building. For proper safety you should order a chimney inspection at least once per year.</p>
