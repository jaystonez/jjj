<p>Having a chimney in your home is more than just having cozy warm nights with a rustic ambiance. It also entails a lot of responsibility and keen observational skills on your end, especially if you want to ensure your chimney’s functionality as well as your family’s safety.</p>
<p>More often than not, our team at <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/" target="_blank">Ashbusters Chimney Service</a> get approached by homeowners presenting concerns or asking certain things and issues about their chimneys. One of the most asked questions is regarding their chimney draft.</p>
<p><strong><em>So, here’s a short reference that has everything you would need to know about chimney drafts:</em></strong></p>
<h3>What is a chimney draft?</h3>
<p>The chimney draft, or simply called the draft, is the pulling action in your chimney caused by the negative pressure mechanism that’s at play inside each and every one of your chimneys. You see, your chimney produces hot air. When the heat generated inside the chimney reaches a certain level, it starts to pull air through the firebox, and thus, the draft.</p>
<h3>How will you be able to identify a draft problem?</h3>
<p>This is relatively easy to spot. All you need to watch out for are the 3 cardinal signs that are indicative of a chimney draft problem. First, you need to observe the air inside your home. If air begins to enter your home from your chimney, then that’s a sign that something is definitely wrong. Second, when you have unusual trying to start a fire or keep it burning, that’s another sign. And lastly, if you notice a smokey smell around your house even without a fire burning, then that’s definitely a warning sign.</p>
<h3>How does it affect us?</h3>
<p>Initially or in minute cases, draft problems don’t really pose that much of a threat to us. But according to the C<a href="http://www.csia.org/" target="_blank">himney Safety Institute of America</a>, in worst case scenarios it may turn your home into a risky living environment by becoming a fire and health hazard. Carbon monoxide poisoning can easily occur due to improper draft.</p>
<h3>What can we do?</h3>
<p>The best and smartest thing to do is to contact a <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/contact-us/" target="_blank">chimney expert</a> to check your chimney as soon as possible. Not only will they be able to point out damages and risks, but they would also help you in setting up preventive measure as to avoid dreadful and horrible scenarios from ever occurring.</p>
<p>Chimney draft problems are more common than you think. For all you know you have one going on in your home at this very moment. So what are you waiting for? Pick up the phone or open your computers and set an appointment as soon as you can.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Carbon Monoxide (CO) is a odorless, colorless gas that is produced by burning fuel. It is slightly lighter than air, which causes it to rise to the top of the space it occupies. It is very toxic for both humans and animals, and should be avoided in high concentrations. Homes with fireplaces are especially prone to accidental CO poisoning, if not properly vented. For this reason, you need to have a regular chimney cleaning and inspection to make sure you don&#8217;t have a dangerous situation on your hands.</p>
<p>Here are some common facts regarding CO and CO poisoning:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hundreds of people are killed each year by accidental CO exposure.</li>
<li>Once CO is absorbed into the bloodstream, it blocks oxygen from getting to vital organs.</li>
<li>CO is known as the &#8220;silent killer&#8221; because it is so difficult to detect unless you have a CO monitor.</li>
<li>CO poisoning causes sleepiness, fatigue, and mental confusion, making it much harder to remove yourself from the contaminated area.</li>
</ul>
<p>A couple of the ways that chimneys can be big emitters of CO is if they are dirty or obstructed. A dirty chimney is covered in creosote, which is highly flammable. Creosote can catch on fire, causing damage to the chimney and home. An obstructed chimney will keep the smoke from exiting the chimney properly, and can even send the smoke back into the house. Obstructions can come from birds nests, insect or animal nests, and natural debris like leaves or branches. Chimney caps can help avoid these types of obstructions.</p>
<p>CO poisoning can come from a variety of other places, like grills, furnaces, and even your car. Never grill indoors, or underneath a covering. Make sure your furnace is working properly, and is not putting out any dangerous carbon monoxide. When starting your car in a garage, make sure the door is open. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission has a very helpful list of <a href="http://www.cpsc.gov/cpscpub/pubs/466.html" target="_blank">carbon monoxide facts</a> that just may help save your life.</p>
