<p>Think about it: Just like your chimney, your dryer vents are expelling hot air and byproducts from a heating appliance. So if the vents get clogged, that expulsion is halted, and heat builds up. Since dryer lint is extremely flammable, a clogged dryer vent quickly becomes a serious fire hazard.</p>
<p>Not sure if it&#8217;s time to have your dryer vents cleaned? Here are some simple signs that usually indicate vents that are in need of attention.</p>
<h3>Your Laundry Isn&#8217;t Drying</h3>
<p>Are you running the dryer for a normal amount of time, and still finding damp clothes and towels once the dryer stops? That doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean your dryer is failing. When clogged vents keep heat and moisture from moving out of the home, your dryer has to work harder to try and do its job, and it ends up taking more time, using more energy and taking more money to get your laundry dry. That creates more lint build-up, and makes the situation worse. More often than not, a thorough dryer vent cleaning will get your dryer back to doing its job properly again.</p>
<h3>You Notice Excess Heat On Your Dryer And In The Area Around It</h3>
<p>The harder your dryer has to work, the more heat builds up in the vents and in the machine itself. So if you notice that your dryer is particularly hot, or that it feels warmer in the room around the dryer, that could indicate a clogged vent and an overworked appliance.</p>
<h3>You Smell Something Musty Or Mildew</h3>
<p>If a clogged vent is preventing your dryer from working properly, you may notice a musty odor to your laundry, since dampness isn’t able to escape properly or efficiently.</p>
<h3>You See Excess Lint</h3>
<p>Take a look at the dryer termination outside. Do you see a lot of lint around the opening and going into the ducts? Your eyes don&#8217;t lie &#8212; that build-up means you&#8217;re due for a cleaning.</p>
<p>Ashbusters can help keep your laundry dry and your home safer &#8212; if you&#8217;re due for a dryer vent cleaning appointment, or just want to know more about dryer vent cleaning, give us a call!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When you consider that there are over 40 dryer fires in the US alone each and every day, then you must consider a product that is known to warn you of danger ahead of time. We care because we know this device will save lives. It does all this by monitoring the dryer exhaust system for any issues that might appear as lint builds up over time.</p>
<p>You will be able to follow the LintAlert® by watching a series of LED lights that indicate how your dryer is functioning. If the airflow becomes restricted and dangerous an alarm is sounded to alert you of a potential fire hazard.</p>
<p>When a dryer is struggling to dry clothes, this is an indication that there is an exhaust issue of some sort. Of course, it will eventually show up on the utility bills. What you don’t see is how the combination of excess lint trapped with the hot air that has no where to go can easily catch fire in your home. The number one reason is operational deficiency, including failure to clean!</p>
<p>Because clothes dryers account for over <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/2007_us_fire_admin.pdf" target="_blank">15,000 structure fires</a>, 15 deaths and 400 injuries annually we have decided to not only recommend LintAlert®,  but to also have it available for our customers. Ashbusters believes in maintenance and cleaning for chimneys and dryers and doing everything possible to eliminate any potential fire in your home.  We also know that taking the necessary steps toward safety will give you the peace of mind you and your family deserve. Using LintAlert® as instructed and recommended will give you that peace of mind as well as helps you keep your dryer in tip top shape for fire safety. It will also keep your utility bills as low as possible.</p>
<p>If you have any questions in regard to the LintAlert® or would like to ask any additional questions, don’t hesitate to <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/contact-us/">contact Ashbusters.net</a>.</p>
