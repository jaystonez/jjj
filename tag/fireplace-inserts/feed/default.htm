				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Want to convert an old wood-burning fireplace to a more convenient and attractive gas-operated one? Gas inserts can be the perfect solution to modernize your old hearth. At Ashbusters, we carry many styles of <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/catalog/fireplaces-and-stoves/gas-inserts/">gas inserts</a> to suit both traditional and contemporary decors. To help you learn more about these fireplace makeovers, we would like to tell you more about the advantages of installing these inserts. According to <a href="http://www.houselogic.com/home-advice/fireplaces-chimneys/gas-fireplace-inserts-pros-cons/" target="_blank">HouseLogic</a>, a home-improvement website sponsored by the National Association of Realtors, the benefits of gas inserts can provide the “ultimate in convenience.</p>

<h3>Advantages of Gas Fireplace Inserts</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>less hassle - </strong>Imagine being able to start your fire with the push of a remote control button; you can with a gas fireplace. You will not have to deal with the chore of bringing in heavy firewood; nor will you have the cleaning involved with a wood-burning fireplace.</li>
<li><strong>lower cost -</strong> Installing an insert is much less expensive than rebuilding a new fireplace. You will also save money on your heating bills as gas heat is more energy-efficient.</li>
<li><strong>more environmentally-friendly - </strong>If you worry about the pollution caused by burning wood, a gas insert can alleviate that concern. Gas burns cleaner air &#8212; inside and outside your home. You are also saving energy since the efficiency levels of gas fireplaces are much higher than a standard wood-burning fireplace.</li>
<li><strong>easier remodel - </strong>When you want to update the look of your fireplace or even to convert to gas from wood fuel, gas inserts make changing your hearth’s decor and fuel source a simple task. Able to fit into a masonry fireplace or a pre-fabricated fireplace, inserts are then vented through your existing chimney. With the different sizes and styles of gas inserts, you are certain to find your perfect new fireplace look.</li>
<li><strong>fewer creosote worries - </strong>Since gas-burning does not create as much creosote as burning wood, you will have less maintenance. You will still need to have your chimney cleaned annually by a Chimney Institute of America-certified chimney sweep, like our chimney technicians at Ashbusters; however, you will not have to worry about scheduling multiple cleanings throughout the year to rid your chimney walls of large deposits of creosote.</li>
<li><strong>zone heating -</strong> A gas fireplace insert can heat a living space between 1,000 to 3,000 square feet, depending on the size of the insert. You are guaranteed comfortable warmth in the room where your fireplace is located, and you can turn down the thermostat in the rest of the house, which saves you money on heating bills.</li>
<li><strong>choice of vented or ventless -</strong> While a vented gas insert is the safest choice because they exhaust all of the smoke and gases through your chimney, you cannot install a vented gas fireplace insert without an existing place to vent the gas. Ventless inserts can be installed anywhere you would like a fireplace to be; however, some states have banned this type of gas-fueled appliance because the smoke and gases remain inside your home. Fortunately, many ventless inserts are now equipped with an oxygen-depletion sensor that shut them down before carbon monoxide reaches dangerous levels.</li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the winter approaching, families are looking into learning how they can save both the environment and costs while heating their homes.  There are numerous energy-efficient ways to heat your house that do not take much effort on your part. Believe it or not, making sure your chimney is in good working order impacts energy-efficiency, whether you have  a fireplace or a wood stove. Now is the time to call us and schedule your annual cleaning and <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/services/inspections/" target="_blank">inspection</a>. If you are sticking with the heating system you currently have, a clean and functional chimney allows unobstructed air flow and proper draft.</p>
<div id="attachment_3036" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Increasing-Energy-Efficiency-Nashville-TN-Ashbusters.jpg" class="highslide" onclick="return hs.expand(this)" ><img class="size-medium wp-image-3036" alt="Ensuring that your chimney is in good working order is an easy way to increase energy-efficiency." src="http://www.ashbusters.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Increasing-Energy-Efficiency-Nashville-TN-Ashbusters-300x214.jpg" width="300" height="214" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Ensuring that your chimney is in good working order is an easy way to increase energy-efficiency.</p></div>
<p>If you are interested in installing or upgrading your appliance, there are a few things to keep in mind.  First, make sure that the size of whatever you are using to heat the area is the appropriate size for the space being heated.  When the appliance is too big, people tend to burn fires at a low smolder to avoid producing too much heat, which will increase the overall wasted fuel amount and contributes to air pollution.  Due to the chemicals released when burning wood, some places may prohibit or restrict your wood-burning appliances.  You may have to consider upgrading to a newer model certified by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  They include specially design catalytic combustors that clean the exhaust gas and generate more heat.  This will also help prevent creosotes from building up.</p>
<p>Another method of heating is solar powered.  Active solar heating uses the solar energy to heat a fluid, either a liquid or air, and transfer the heat into the interior of your home.  If the solar system cannot provide the entire amount of energy needed you may need a back up system. Space heaters are also a common winter heating solution.  They work well for heating a certain room or area, depending on the heater’s size, and can run off electricity, propane, natural gas, or kerosene.  However, these space heaters if used incorrectly can be dangerous so make sure you know of all the safety requirements before using any type of heating method.</p>
<p>All of us are thinking of ways to save money. Maintaining proper draft out of the chimney is a critical piece. It isn&#8217;t unusual for animals, birds or debris to get into your chimney in between annual cleanings. It is also common for water to make its way into the chimney and provide a breeding ground for mold, as well as cracks to your flue liner. Bottom line: if airflow is restricted or compromised, your heating bill is going up. And nobody can afford that.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You love the look of a fireplace, but you do not want to be bothered with buying or chopping down wood for the fire. <a href="http://regency-fire.com/Products/Wood/Wood-Inserts/CI1250.aspx" target="_blank">Fireplace inserts</a> are an ideal solution, but you should know the difference in the different types of inserts to get the desired effect. Here is quick breakdown of inserts and some of the pros and cons for each one.</p>
<p><strong>Electric Fireplace Inserts</strong><br />
Electric inserts are extremely low maintenance, but  also offers a less realistic experience. Some of the lower end models have very poor effect, but you there are models that have impressive flickering flames to enhance the overall look and feel of the fireplace. A major benefit of using one of these fireplaces is that you do not need any ventilation. There are also mountable and freestanding units available for homes that currently have no fireplace.</p>
<p><strong>Gas Fireplace Inserts</strong><br />
If your home uses natural gas and you want to have something that is closer to a real fire, a gas-burning insert is a good choice. Gas fireplaces tend to be more effective as a heat source than most electric fireplaces, as they are capable of a higher BTU output. This type of unit is very effective for zone heating. Typically, the logs used for these fireplaces are made of ceramic. While they do not all require ventilation, be sure to check the manufacturer&#8217;s guidelines before installing.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2262" title="CI1250 Wood burning fireplace insert from Regency" alt="CI1250 Wood burning fireplace insert from Regency" src="http://www.ashbusters.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/ashbusters-CI1250-wood-burning-fireplace-insert.jpg" width="247" height="192" /></p>
<p><strong>Wood Fireplace Inserts</strong><br />
While this is the most natural of all inserts, it is also one of the more costly and least efficient as a heat source. Since you will need ventilation, much of the heat created will escape through the chimney. However, wood can generally be found cheaply, so this may offset the heat loss financially compared to gas or electric. You may also require some modifications to your existing fireplace or the unit itself before it can be used safely. If you were trying to avoid chimney maintenance costs, know that annual inspections are still recommended.</p>
