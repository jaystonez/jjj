				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>‘Tis the season for holiday decorations and Christmas lights. Santa will soon be coming down the chimney to deliver presents for the young children in your home. If you are hanging stockings from your working fireplace, be sure to take the utmost care when doing so.</p>
<p>Most Christmas stockings are made from highly flammable materials, so if you are hanging them from your working fireplace, you are risking a fire in your home. If you have a large mantle, it is wise to consider hanging the stockings higher than normal, so they are far away from any flames or sparks that may arise. In general, keep flammable stockings as far away from a fire as possible. As always, use a crate or cage to protect Christmas decorations, rugs, and other flammable materials from sparks or sputtering fires. Christmas is a time of year prone to more home fires because of holiday lights and the abundance of decorations, so be sure to use the utmost caution and care when decorating your home, especially when decorating your mantle!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chimney and fireplace upkeep during the off months, and before you use your chimney is vital for the overall maintenance of your home. It’s important you properly inspect and clean your chimney before you use it. Beyond that, fireplace maintenance is very important during the winter months, when it is in use.</p>
<p>Only burn what you are supposed to burn in your fireplace. Plastics and other synthetic materials should not be used in your fireplace. Also, don’t use fire starters that aren’t recommended for indoor fireplace use. Between fireplace uses, be sure to properly sweep out your fireplace. By regularly cleaning your fireplace you are eliminating a potentially hazardous and messy situation inside your home. Use a cage to protect your family, and your fireplace. Some <a title="Firewood Facts" href="http://www.ashbusters.net/about-us/firewood/">types of wood</a> may crackle and sputter while burning, so a cage will make sure nothing (and no one) gets burned. Enjoy your fireplace all winter long, and do so with the utmost safety and care. Maintain your fireplace throughout the winter to keep it in proper working order.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chimney cracks can be very dangerous, and should be professionally repaired by a chimney cleaning and repair service before your chimney is in use. Be sure your chimney is in proper working order before winter is here.</p>
<p>Chimney cracks are dangerous for a variety of reasons. Firstly, <a title="Child Safety Indoors" href="http://children.webmd.com/environmental-exposure-head2toe/slideshow-indoor-air-quality">chimney cracks can release potentially harmful chemicals</a> into your home, where your family can inhale them. On the other hand, if heat is escaping through your chimney, it’s not going into your home. To this end, it’s important to make sure your chimney is in working order for efficiency and heat output. Also, small cracks in your chimney may not seem like major repairs that need to be made. On the contrary, chimney cracks are signs of potentially greater damage. If the damage is not already done, a chimney crack could be a warning that more extensive (and expensive) chimney damage is upon you. Stay safe this holiday season. Be sure to have your chimney inspected by a professional chimney sweep before you use it each winter season.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The very first thing you think when asked the question of why you should clean your chimney, is fire; and that is definitely a good answer. However, there are other reasons to <a title="Chimney Sweeping and Cleaning" href="http://www.ashbusters.net/services/sweeping/">keep your chimneys clean</a> that are not much different from reasons to keep everything else in your home clean. The main one after preventing a fire is to remove dust that can contain contaminants from the air in your home that can get into your air supply through the fireplace. Soot is extremely fine and if not contained can add to unclean conditions in your home for anyone that has breathing issues such as asthma. Making sure your chimney is cleaned annually can help reduce this issue.</p>
<p>We use a vacuum system that is second to none with a triple layer HEPA filter to control dust and capture any soot or residue that is released. We use brushes on rods to sweep the flue, hand brushes for the firebox and smoke chamber and thoroughly sweep the chimney from top to bottom. If we find any damage or needed repairs it is documented on video or with digital photos that can be sent to you. Once the job is completed we will leave with you a copy of the written evaluation and as long as the homeowner is present, there is a 100% satisfaction guarantee.</p>
