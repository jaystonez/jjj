				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you’re new to fireplace or stove ownership, there are a few key things that you’ll need to learn straight away. One of those things: proper burning practices, like using only seasoned or kiln-dried firewood in your<a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/catalog/fireplaces-and-stoves/wood-fireplaces/" target="_blank"> wood-burning appliance</a>, and making sure your damper is completely open before you start a fire. Another: the need for regular maintenance — including annual chimney inspection  and chimney sweeping  appointments — to keep your system running efficiently and effectively. And along with those basics, you’ll want to know why you’re doing all that.</p>
<p>The answer to the latter, in a lot of cases, is creosote. If you’re not familiar with creosote, using a hearth appliance quickly makes you become familiar with it — it’s a constant part of using a wood-burning appliance. Want to know more? Here’s a quick creosote F.A.Q.</p>
<p><strong>How Do I Know If There’s Creosote In My Chimney?</strong></p>
<div id="attachment_3315" style="width: 299px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Creosote-F.A.Q.-Nashville-TN-Ashbusters.jpg" class="highslide" onclick="return hs.expand(this)" ><img class="size-medium wp-image-3315" src="http://www.ashbusters.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Creosote-F.A.Q.-Nashville-TN-Ashbusters-289x300.jpg" alt="Ignoring annual chimney cleanings and inspections can be dangerous to your home and your family. Let us help you minimize your risks. " width="289" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Ignoring annual chimney cleanings and inspections can be dangerous to your home and your family. Let us help you minimize your risks.</p></div>
<p>Unlike some other byproducts of combustion — like colorless and odorless carbon monoxide — creosote makes itself known. You may smell a smoky odor coming from your chimney that indicates creosote’s presence, or you might see creosote deposits around your flue opening. Depending on the level of creosote you have (levels 1, 2 an 3 are how hearth professionals categorize the progression of creosote residue), it might look powdery and velvety, crunchy and flaky, thick and drippy or hard and shiny, in colors ranging from brown to black.</p>
<p>But really, here’s the underlying truth about whether or not there’s creosote in your chimney: If you’ve been burning wood in your fireplace or stove, there’s creosote in your chimney. Its development is a natural part of burning wood. The combustion of wood creates a mix of byproducts — including smoke, small particles, tar fog and gases — that rise up the chimney and meet the cooler flue walls, condensing into a liquid. That liquid residue is creosote, and it layers and thickens over time and with use of your appliance.</p>
<p><strong>Can I Stop Creosote From Forming?</strong></p>
<p>You can’t prevent creosote development, but you can use some smart burning practices to limit its build-up. They include the ones we mentioned above — using properly dried wood, and opening your damper completely. Those practices help you develop a fire that’s burning hot enough to encourage proper draft and effective venting.</p>
<p><strong>If Creosote Is So Common, Why Do I Need To Be Concerned About It?</strong></p>
<p>Excessive creosote brings a grab bag of problems along with it. First, there’s the fact that creosote is highly combustible — so the more creosote is lining your flue, the higher the chances of a fire hazard become.</p>
<p>Creosote can also affect your chimney’s ability to vent effectively — if it thickens considerably on your flue walls, it can minimize your chimney’s draft, or even block your flue.</p>
<p><strong>How Do I Get Rid Of Creosote?</strong></p>
<p>On your end, all you need to do to ensure proper creosote removal is to give Ashbusters Chimney Service a call and schedule a <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/services/sweeping/" target="_blank">chimney sweeping  appointment</a>. Our CSIA-certified sweeps use specially designed brushes and tools and a vacuum system with a triple layer HEPA filter to make sure that your flue walls are free of creosote, and your home is free of dust. When professional chimney sweeping is done annually, you can expect your chimney to vent better, longer — and you can rest easy knowing that you’re not leaving a potential fire hazard uncorrected.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about creosote — or want to schedule a chimney sweeping appointment — give Ashbusters a call. We’d love to help you enjoy a clean and well-performing chimney!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;" align="center"><b>Helpful Tips for Your Emergency Escape Plan</b></p>
<p>Every day a lot of undetermined circumstances happen. Some days, you’re okay; doing your usual routine and some days you are literally fighting for your life and going through an unexpected ordeal. We cannot control these events from occurring. We just have to be prepared for it when it happens.</p>
<p>Fires can start with a spark and end in a horrifying scenario. In 2012, over 370,000 homes were burnt to the ground and over 3,000 died in that year. This can be caused by a lot of things; candles, short-circuit, tangled wires, and it does not end there. This is why developing an escape plan for your home is mandatory. Especially if you have kids and old people in your home, it’s best to prepare for this kind of scenario. Better safe than sorry, right?</p>
<div id="attachment_3109" style="width: 203px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Escape-Plan-Tips-Nashville-TN-Ashbusters.jpg" class="highslide" onclick="return hs.expand(this)" ><img class="size-medium wp-image-3109" alt="Want your family to be prepared to escape safely in case of a fire?

" src="http://www.ashbusters.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Escape-Plan-Tips-Nashville-TN-Ashbusters-193x300.jpg" width="193" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Want your family to be prepared to escape safely in case of a fire? Educate, develop and practice, practice, practice.</p></div>
<p>For a more prepared approach in your emergency escape plan, you have to remember these eight helpful tips:</p>
<ol>
<li>Always make sure that when you’re designing your escape plan, everyone living in the home is present. This can help them identify all the things they need to know once the situation has taken place. This can also help your family gauge everyone’s physical conditions, sleeping habits and the like.</li>
<li>Whether in a one storey or to storey house, make sure there are interconnected smoke alarms. Preferably in every room and area. Make sure that this is set at maximum volume so everyone can hear.</li>
<li>The escape routes should not have anything blocking or covering it so that there would be ease when people need to run towards the outside. The windows and doors should be easy-to-open as well. This can be easier for people in their golden years to be accompanied by another young person to carefully but briskly walk towards the exit points.</li>
<li>Make sure that your street number is visible enough for fire fighters to see. This can help them find and reach you quickly, as well as put out the fire immediately. Have everyone memorize the number of the fire department so that anyone can do the calling.</li>
<li>Your escape plan must include an outside meeting place; where everyone can meet up once they are already outside the house. You can regroup there and organize yourselves to avoid panic.</li>
<li>For two-storey houses, make sure that there are portable ladders near windows so if the fire has already blazed in the first floor, you can use the ladder to safety.</li>
<li>Do fire drills at least twice a year. Use your smoke alarms to also check if everyone can hear it clearly.</li>
<li>You can establish a timeline for the elderly and their assistant to make their way out. This can also prepare your family for real live fires.</li>
</ol>
<p>Fires can be a result of chimney blockages as well as fireplace negligence. This can trigger the loss of your home in just a matter of minutes. For a worry-free home and a <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/services/chimney-repairs/" target="_blank">clean fireplace and chimney</a>, call upon the certified chimney sweeps of Ashbusters Chimney Service. They have been in the business for over 25 years and continue to please their customers. They are equipped with the right amount of skill and knowledge that will prevent fires to happen in your home. They can also teach you how to develop an effective escape plan. Your safety is their priority.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Burning the Right Kind of Wood</b></p>
<p><b> </b>Newly chopped firewood is approximately 60% water, and that percentage can go even higher. This causes the wood not to burn as well. You need to season the wood first in order to let the liquid dry out until the moisture is around 20% or less. Then, it is ready for an efficient burn. Seasoning firewood means allowing the water content of the wood evaporate, which means not exposing the wood to additional moisture. Drying firewood will make it burn easily and safely.</p>
<div id="attachment_2950" style="width: 295px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Depositphotos_2486706_original-w800-h600.jpg" class="highslide" onclick="return hs.expand(this)" ><img class="size-medium wp-image-2950" alt="Make sure there is air flow in your stacks - Nashville TN - Ashbusters" src="http://www.ashbusters.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Depositphotos_2486706_original-w800-h600-285x300.jpg" width="285" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Make sure there is air flow in your stacks &#8211; Nashville TN &#8211; Ashbusters</p></div>
<p>Burning unseasoned firewood or partially seasoned wood is chancy. Unseasoned wood creates additional creosote. Creosote is the oily sticky substance that doesn&#8217;t burn and is extremely flammable. It takes time before the wood gets fully dried, but it can be done in a stress-free way using some tricks and practices to speed up the process.</p>
<ul>
<li>When chopping wood, make the thickness 6-8 inches and approximately 18” long.  Place the wood outside where it is convenient, yet not so close to the home that you have to worry about <a href="http://entomology.cornell.edu/cals/entomology/extension/idl/upload/Firewood-Insects.pdf" target="_blank">pests</a></li>
<li>Pile the wood correctly so that the wood is not sitting directly on the ground. Put a base under to keep it off the ground and to avoid soil moisture. A pallet is a good base because it is a few inches higher off the ground.</li>
<li>Make space between the wood stack and the wall to sustain air flow. Using a pallet as the base of your stack will also provide air flow to your stack. Air can speed up the drying process.</li>
<li>Only cover the top 1 to 2 feet of the stack, but leave the sides open. Covering any more than that impedes air circulation. If the wood is still green, covering more will just hold in the moisture, and prevent a natural air-dry. Covering just the top also helps keep rain and snow off the wood pile.</li>
<li>Place your pile in a location where it can get the most possible sunlight throughout the day.</li>
</ul>
<p>It can take up to a full year to thoroughly season a pile of wood, so make sure your technique is correct. Remember, seasoned wood is not only safer, as it produces less creosote, but it also gives you a faster and more warming fire. There will also be less smoke if you use dry wood. How do you know  if the wood is <a href="http://ccetompkins.org/energy/heating-wood/storing-and-drying-firewood">dry</a>? If you hit two pieces of wood together and hear a crisp sound, the wood is dry. If the sound is more muffled, you may be dealing with wet wood.  Bottom line: prepare your wood early, keep it stacked to avoid additional moisture and yet still allow air flow. These few tips will help you get the most for your money.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the best things you can do to improve your home’s fire safety is stop walking away from the stove while you are cooking. Accounting for roughly <a href="http://www.nfpa.org/categoryList.asp?categoryID=282&amp;URL=Safety%20Information/For%20consumers/Causes/Cooking" target="_blank">44 percent of all home fires</a>, the way you cook can be seriously damaging to your family’s well-being! Not only are you what you eat, but how you cook can determine whether your family stays safe.</p>
<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2832" title="Cooking Fire - Nashville TN - Ashbusters Chimney Service" alt="Cooking Fire - Nashville TN - Ashbusters Chimney Service" src="http://www.ashbusters.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/ashbusters-cooking-fire-199x300.jpg" width="199" height="300" />
<p>Another good measure to take is to have your clothes dryer venting professionally cleaned from time to time. How often this needs to be done varies with use and other factors, but dryer vents are notorious culprits in house fires. Highly flammable lint can also gather in air ducts throughout the house, so they should be inspected at the same time.</p>
<p><b>Keep an Eye on Fire </b></p>
<p>Your fireplace system is another obvious thing to attend to regularly; perhaps the most obvious of all. The only place besides the stove where we purposely start indoor fires, the fireplace deserves to be maintained in tip-top condition. The affordable services of CSIA certified chimney sweeps can prevent a lot of avoidable expense and heartache.</p>
<p>Outdoor fireplaces, grills, and fire pits start their share of house fires, either through inattention to their condition or carelessness in their use. Grills and fire pits should never be placed close to the house or flammables, and they need a steady surface beneath them. They also have to be watched, just like stoves, since a flying spark outdoors can be just as much of a problem.</p>
<p><b>Nothing Tasty About Smoked Houses</b></p>
<p>From simple things that you can do better yourself to obviously complicated systems that have to be <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/services/">examined by professionals</a>, the effort is worth it. The only thing you want going up in smoke is your salmon under the hood of a clean grill in good condition. So kill the fire where it is, until you can give it some attention and keep it where it belongs.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every year more and more people are looking forward to celebrate their summer vacations where there is lots of camping, swimming, out-of-town trips, picnics, and family reunions. However, summertime is also an important time for fire prevention, because many fire incidents and injuries happen during this time. Every year approximately 8,600 Americans are injured due to incidents of fire caused by wood burning, charcoal, and propane grilling. In the year 2010, 73% of injuries caused by fireworks happened in between June 18 – July 18.</p>
<p>Family camping is also widespread during summer months. It is necessary to follow the rules of the park or other theme areas when making camp fires. Summer is the time to enjoy and relax, and following some simple fire safety tips will help you have a memorable summer experience.</p>
<ul>
<li>As much as possible, do not use fireworks at home. You can watch fireworks displays at parks where you can enjoy their beauty more safely. In fact, towns and cities all over Middle Tennessee put on their own fireworks displays. If you do use them at home, do not light them inside the house or near gas tanks. Always make sure that there is water readily available in case of fire, and ensure that fire extinguishers are working. Do not stand close to the fireworks, and do not wear loose clothing in order to prevent fire from reaching your clothes. Make sure that there are no children near the fireworks, and do not allow them to handle the fireworks.</li>
<li>When barbeque grilling, make sure that the propane gas and the fuel line are properly connected. Ensure that the tubes are not blocked, and do not fill the propane tank to the fullest. Take safety precautions when using lighter fluid, and never add it to a grill that is already lit. Keep the lighters and matches away from the fire, and dispose of the coal properly. Do not grill in an enclosed area, because the smoke will emit poisonous carbon monoxide.</li>
<li>During campfires, build the fire in an area far from grass and other plants so that the fire will not spread. Keep the fire small so it will be easier to extinguish. Do not leave the fire unattended, and always have water ready in case the fire starts to get too big.</li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Whether you are a parent or a school teacher, it is necessary to educate your kids about fire safety and preventing fires. Check out these tips in order to ensure proper fire safety practices at school and at home. Here are some important tips you may follow which can be of great help:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Don&#8217;t play with matches.</strong> Teach your children how to properly use matches. Your kids should bear in mind that the only time they can strike a match is when they are using a piece of wood in a fireplace or in a stove. Even better, make sure they understand that your supervision is necessary if they want to use matches. Keep matches out of the reach of young children.</li>
<li><strong>Set a fire drill.</strong> This is particularly relevant when you are a school teacher or administrator. It is important to set such drills at least twice a semester so they will know how to properly exit the classroom. Through this, they will be able to know how to head out to the yard of your school through the closest door in a quick and orderly fashion as soon as the fire alarm rings. They should fully understand that they need to stay outside the building until school officials or fire department personnel tells them that it is safe to go back inside.</li>
<li><strong>Teaching the proper way to use an oven and a stove. </strong>Yes, your children need to be oriented with the various appliances inside your home as part of their learning process. However, they should be taught well about the importance of properly turning on and off the stove and the oven when they are cooking food.</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember: you must educate your kids about fire safety so you will have peace-of-mind, ensuring that your house or your school is well educated in fire safety.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Patio fireplaces come in many shapes or sizes that range from fire pits with open flames to regular fireplaces with hearths that resemble a regular fireplace that you would see in the home. They also have many different fuel choices from gas to propane and the traditional wood burning option. Potential buyers of outdoor fireplaces have a lot of options today when purchasing their ideal outdoor fireplace.</p>
<p>However, no matter what type of fireplace you choose for your outdoor space there are things you will need to do to keep that area safe. One of the first things you can do is to keep the fire and flame to a manageable level. This is especially true of a fire pit that can get out of hand easily and blow embers where you don’t want them; on your home.</p>
<p>This brings us to another point; know what way the wind is blowing and adjust accordingly. This is just a part of anticipating a problem before it becomes one. If the wind is blowing toward your house, having a fire for that night might not be wise unless you have a hearth style where you can control the embers better or a fuel other than wood.</p>
<p>One thing that is just smart whenever there is a fire is to keep a sealed and inspected fire extinguisher on hand and make sure the adults around know where it is in case you need to use it. Be aware of children playing around an outdoor fire. This is one of the many hazards for young children who don’t yet understand the dangers of fire.</p>
<p>When loading wood from your woodpile to the fire it is always best to do so with fire retardant gloves on to protect your hands. Make use of the screen for your outdoor fireplace because it is designed to keep the fire in the fire box and keep embers from flying out.</p>
<p>If you are using a fire pit or portable fireplace of any kind make sure you place it clear of trees or low hanging vines or branches that might catch fire. Additionally you need to keep about a 3 feet perimeter clear of anything so the embers that do escape are easily seen and extinguished.</p>
<p>One of the most important things about outdoor fires is to make sure they are completely out before retiring for the evening. You can do this by using a hose to douse the fire or dirt to smother it. If using an alternative fuel, make sure the source is turned off.</p>
