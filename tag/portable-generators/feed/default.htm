It is necessary to read the manual before using a portable generator to ensure that you are using it properly.</p>
<p>Equipment Safety</p>
<ul>
<li>Use new fuel for your generator. If you are going to store your generator for 30 days or more, use a fuel stabilizer to calm the petrol.</li>
<li>Allow the generator to cool before refueling, because vapors and fuel are extremely combustible.</li>
<li>Follow the maintenance schedule of your generator in order for it to work its best.</li>
<li>Do not coil the cords because it may cause them to get hot. Uncoil the cords and lay them on a flat surface.</li>
</ul>
<p>Personal Safety</p>
<ul>
<li>Read the manual and follow instructions when operating a portable generator.</li>
<li>Use your generator outside the home, and make sure the place is properly ventilated.</li>
<li>While using your generator, use a battery operated carbon monoxide detector.</li>
<li>Keep away combustible materials when operating your portable generator</li>
<li>Operate your generator on level ground</li>
<li>Use heavy duty cords for your generator to handle the electricity load.</li>
<li>Do not plug the generator into your home circuit directly.</li>
<li>Ask an electrician about <strong>Emergency Manual Power Transfer System</strong> if you are planning to connect the generator to your home electrical line.</li>
</ul>
<p>Usage Tips</p>
<ul>
<li>Determine the wattage guide and plan the appliances that you will connect with your generator.</li>
<li>Test your generator before the actual usage so that you will be familiar with how to operate it in case of emergencies.</li>
<li>Always have a flashlight ready to operate the generator easily in the dark.</li>
<li>Place your generator in a convenient place.</li>
<li>Ensure that the battery of your generator is fully charged, especially if it needs an electric start.</li>
<li>Operate your generator relatively often to lubricate the engine.</li>
<li>Keep a supply of new gasoline and make sure that an extension cord is always ready.</li>
<li>Plug the appliances in one after the other to avoid overloading.</li>
<li>Make sure that your generator has cooled down before storing it.</li>
<li>Cover your generator when not in use to avoid dirt and dust getting into the engine.</li>
</ul>
