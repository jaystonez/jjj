				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You love the look of a fireplace, but you do not want to be bothered with buying or chopping down wood for the fire. <a href="http://regency-fire.com/Products/Wood/Wood-Inserts/CI1250.aspx" target="_blank">Fireplace inserts</a> are an ideal solution, but you should know the difference in the different types of inserts to get the desired effect. Here is quick breakdown of inserts and some of the pros and cons for each one.</p>
<p><strong>Electric Fireplace Inserts</strong><br />
Electric inserts are extremely low maintenance, but  also offers a less realistic experience. Some of the lower end models have very poor effect, but you there are models that have impressive flickering flames to enhance the overall look and feel of the fireplace. A major benefit of using one of these fireplaces is that you do not need any ventilation. There are also mountable and freestanding units available for homes that currently have no fireplace.</p>
<p><strong>Gas Fireplace Inserts</strong><br />
If your home uses natural gas and you want to have something that is closer to a real fire, a gas-burning insert is a good choice. Gas fireplaces tend to be more effective as a heat source than most electric fireplaces, as they are capable of a higher BTU output. This type of unit is very effective for zone heating. Typically, the logs used for these fireplaces are made of ceramic. While they do not all require ventilation, be sure to check the manufacturer&#8217;s guidelines before installing.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2262" title="CI1250 Wood burning fireplace insert from Regency" alt="CI1250 Wood burning fireplace insert from Regency" src="http://www.ashbusters.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/ashbusters-CI1250-wood-burning-fireplace-insert.jpg" width="247" height="192" /></p>
<p><strong>Wood Fireplace Inserts</strong><br />
While this is the most natural of all inserts, it is also one of the more costly and least efficient as a heat source. Since you will need ventilation, much of the heat created will escape through the chimney. However, wood can generally be found cheaply, so this may offset the heat loss financially compared to gas or electric. You may also require some modifications to your existing fireplace or the unit itself before it can be used safely. If you were trying to avoid chimney maintenance costs, know that annual inspections are still recommended.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Homeowners who are tired of soot and smoke often install a gas fireplace in their masonry chimney system. This does not eliminate the need for chimney maintenance. Acid created by a gas fireplace can eat away at the inside of the chimney. Annual chimney inspection reveals potential problems from gas fireplace emissions before these become expensive or deadly.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2253" title="Ashbusters - Lit Gas Fireplace" alt="Ashbusters - Lit Gas Fireplace" src="http://www.ashbusters.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/ashbusters-lit-gas-fireplace-300x207.jpg" width="300" height="207" /></p>
<p>A gas fireplace vents its exhaust through a chimney. Though it does not produce visible soot like wood does, it can deposit corrosive acids into the chimney. External symptoms may not exist so homeowners are unaware of the damage being created. By the time the exterior of the chimney shows signs of damage, repairs can be expensive and the integrity of the home may be threatened.</p>
<p>The best way to ensure proper operation of a gas fireplace with a masonry chimney is to have a <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/services/inspections/">certified chimney sweep inspect the installation</a>. The resulting information allows the installer to match the fireplace to the chimney. Correct pairing of the heating and venting systems ensures safe and efficient operation. This is especially important when using a high-efficiency gas fireplace with an older chimney.</p>
<p>To burn gas, the fireplace must intake air for combustion. Acid and chlorides contained in this air can be taken in by the fireplace. When water mixes with chlorides, hydrochloric acid results. During combustion, water vapor is produced and if the system does not contain enough heat, this vapor converts to liquid form and creates hydrochloric and other acids.</p>
<p>Corrosion created when water condenses inside the chimney flue can eventually cause the chimney liner to crumble. This may create debris that results in a blockage within the chimney. Deadly carbon monoxide may be unable to escape through the chimney and could travel back into the home. To prevent this from happening, have annual inspections performed by a certified chimney sweep.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/catalog/fireplaces-and-stoves/">Installing a fireplace</a> in your home makes your place cozy, warm and intimate. It also increases the value of your home. Fireplaces are a good accent to your house besides the fact that they are important too. Fireplaces are ideal for relaxation and for spending time with family. Choosing where to place your fireplace at home can be one of the most stressful decisions that you may encounter when beautifying your home.</p>
<p>The first thing that you need to consider in choosing the area for your fireplace is to know how you want your fireplace to contribute to the overall look of your house. Consider the area, including its parameters and layout, to see if the fireplace will fit in there. Measure the space to get an idea of how big (or small) your fireplace will be. This will also help you decide on what style or design will fit in your chosen location. Make sure it looks good with the other furnishings that are in your living room.</p>
<p>Another thing to consider is the type of fireplace that you want for your home. It may be a wood or gas burning fireplace. A gas burning fireplace is better if you will be starting from scratch. This keeps you from extensive chimney building. If you have a wood hearth installed already, you may want to convert it to a gas fireplace. Others may decide on wood fireplaces because of the thrill of cutting and burning wood in the fireplace, and to get a more traditional look. Fireplaces also come with different accessories that you will need to have in your house. Fireplace screens, mantles, and wood racks should have a place in your living room as well. Materials for fireplaces vary from wood, copper, iron, bricks and marble. Choose the one that will complement the other furniture and style in your living room. This will help you fully appreciate the beauty of your fireplace.</p>
