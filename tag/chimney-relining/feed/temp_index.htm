				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Being exposed to weather elements and the high temperatures of a fire makes the chimney susceptible to damage. A chimney may look great on the outside but its interior may be another story. If a chimney with a clay flue liner becomes damaged, it is typically rebuilt or relined with stainless steel material. However, there is a much less expensive option called HeatShield.<br />
<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2295" title="HeatShield Chimney Liner Repair" alt="HeatShield Chimney Liner Repair" src="http://www.ashbusters.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/ashbusters-heatshield-logo-300x93.jpg" width="300" height="93" /><br />
This <a href="http://cecurechimney.com/" target="_blank">chimney repair-resurfacing system</a> can restore a clay chimney flue liner at a reasonable price for you. It eliminates draft issues and hazards created by cracks, spalling, and gaps in a masonry chimney. Small defects like these can lead to huge problems if they are not addressed in a timely manner. These big problems carry big price tags and can endanger the health and safety of home occupants.</p>
<p>HeatShield Cerfractory technology has been tested repeatedly and is proven to withstand corrosive flue gases, moisture, and temperatures that exceed 2,900 degrees Fahrenheit. This sealant material restores the integrity of the flue, enabling optimal operation. Depending on the issue, either a sleeve relining system or a repair system will be recommended to restore the chimney to its original efficiency and safety levels.</p>
<p>When mortar is missing from between flue tiles, a system is used to perform joint repair. It the flue has other minor defects like a spalled or cracked flue that is otherwise sound, resurfacing is typically recommended. Resurfacing applies a special coating material over the entire flue. Repairs are verified with camera technology to ensure that they meet standards.</p>
<p>HeatShield was developed in Europe and has been in use for more than 20 years. The hybrid ceramic-refractory coating is proven effective through lab testing and daily use. If a chimney sweep notices defects in the clay flue liner and recommends a HeatShield system, take this recommendation seriously and review the options.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We offer a variety of products for home owners and their chimneys. One of our favorites, however, is <a title="HeatShield" href="http://www.ashbusters.net/services/heatshield/">HeatShield®</a> by CeCURE Chimney Systems. This innovative product can save you from having to install a stainless steel chimney liner. Gaps and cracks are simply a part of owning a chimney built of mortar. There are a variety of fixes for this, including a total rebuild of the chimney. However, if it is appropriate for your situation, we love recommending HeatShield®.</p>
<p>For a long time, stainless steel liners were the only viable option for relining a chimney whose clay liner had cracked or become damaged. Now you can fully restore that clay liner, and avoid an expensive rebuild or stainless steel insert. Here are just some of the chimney conditions that cause dangerous situations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deteriorated mortar between clay flue liners</li>
<li>Cracked clay liners</li>
<li>Spalled clay flue liners or tiles (flaking)</li>
<li>Eroded clay liner</li>
<li>Gaps and holes between flue tiles</li>
<li>Cracked flue tiles</li>
</ul>
<p>Another reason we offer this type of relining solution is because customers may have a tendency to avoid taking care of a damaged chimney if it isn&#8217;t cost effective. We want to offer something that will compel them to act, because a damaged chimney is not just inefficient, but it is also dangerous. One of the leading causes of chimney fires is a cracked chimney. In fact, the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) states,“If the flue liner in a chimney has softened, cracked or otherwise deteriorated so that it no longer has the ability to contain the products of combustion (i.e., heat, moisture, creosote, and flue gases), it shall be removed and replaced, repaired or relined…” NFPA 211-Standard for Chimneys, Fireplaces, Vents and Solid Fuel-Burning Appliances (2006).</p>
<p>So, don&#8217;t wait any longer to have your chimney repaired. It isn&#8217;t just a cost consideration. It is very much a safety consideration. Please feel free to <a title="Contact Us" href="http://www.ashbusters.net/contact-us/">contact us</a> with any questions, and we will be glad to help.</p>
