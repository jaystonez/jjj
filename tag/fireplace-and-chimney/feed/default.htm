				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You have decided to add a fireplace to your home. It will add ambiance and offer alternative winter heating, but should you choose a wood burning or gas burning fireplace? It really all comes down to a matter of preference, as both types of fireplaces have their benefits and drawbacks for consumers. Here are a few of the highlights to help make this decision easier.</p>
<p>Wood burning fireplaces offer a more traditional look and of course, burn real wood. This offers the benefit of that unique scent as well as the crackling of an open flame. While past options were quite limited, the modern day homeowner has many more options available concerning the design and placement of their fireplace.</p>
<p>On the downside, since it is real wood burning, you are going to have to buy wood or cut it yourself. The fireplace will also need replenishing throughout the day or night to ensure the fire does not go out. This can be a chore for some individuals, as they would rather just sit back and enjoy the fire. The chimney will need to be inspected and/or cleaned on a regular basis to ensure fire safety within the home.</p>
<p>A gas burning fireplace offers many of the benefits of a wood burning fireplace, literally at the flick of a switch. There are ceramic logs that can be put in place to create an authentic look as well as dancing flames that crackle while the fire is burning. The designs of these fireplaces are very flexible, and often offer easier placement compared to a traditional fireplace.</p>
<p>There is also the benefit of not needing the same type of ventilation as a wood burning unit. In other words, you won&#8217;t need all of the parts that make up a wood burning chimney flue. Because no chimney is needed, the heat created by the fire remains completely in the home. This can make it a more effective secondary source for heating during the winter. It is important to remember, however, that gas burning fireplaces also need regular inspections.</p>
