<li>Cracks need to be repaired.<b></b></li>
<li>It matters if the cracks are dormant or active.<b></b></li>
<li>The cause of the cracks is important to determine.<b></b></li>
<li>Repointing may not be a lasting solution.<b></b></li>
</ul>
<p>You will not likely be able to meet all the above criteria when attempting to repair cracks yourself. Calling in a professional will save you time and money. No two cracks are the same. The General Services Administration provides some useful information here: <a href="http://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/111626" target="_blank">http://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/111626</a>.</p>
<p>Some cracks let water into your masonry while others admit debris, insects, and contaminants that contribute to mold. All of those cracks need to be repaired. Cracks that are doing none of those things aren’t really a problem, but are cosmetic issues. That might be important if you are trying to sell your home, as the cracks could be a warning sign to the new buyer.</p>
<p>Whether cracks are old and “stable” or new and “developing” is extremely important to figure out what is causing them. If they are dormant, different materials may be used in repairs than if they are active. Determining the dormancy of a crack can also impact how time-sensitive the repair will be. Some cracks need an urgent response.</p>
<p>Both the method and the materials used to repair cracks in masonry depend on what caused them. Damage caused by a crawling vine is not approached the same way as an improperly constructed chimney crown, even if water penetration results from both. Determining the cause of cracks in masonry is so important that special monitors exist to facilitate it.</p>
<p>Repointing may be a solution, but there may be additional changes needed to keep the water out. Mortar replacement alone will likely be a temporary fix. These decisions are complicated and you should consult a certified chimney sweep to help you protect your fireplace system from moisture and other contaminants.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just like your roof, a chimney is going to degrade over time. This is even true for masonry chimneys. Because of the weather, masonry will expand and contract, causing the mortar to breakdown. Through these cracks, water can trickle down into your home. Many people assume this is a roof leak, but it&#8217;s actually a chimney leak! Besides the risk of water damage, cracked and damaged chimneys are also a major fire hazard. If your chimney is having these types of issues, it is imperative that you have it serviced immediately.</p>
<p>When you do decide to have your chimney inspected, make sure an expert chimney mason is performing the inspection. With their keen eye, they will be able to spot potential problems that are on the horizon, and can suggest possible remedies. The repair itself should certainly be performed by an expert mason. Improper mason work will most likely lead to an even greater damaged chimney, and quite possibly, a chimney fire. Take care of your family and your home, and have someone that knows what they are doing perform the repair.</p>
<p>The best way to prevent expensive damages is to have regular inspections done on your chimney. This will allow you to fix smaller problems quickly, long before they become costly repairs. For instance, if your chimney inspector sees a small crack that is beginning to form in the chimney flue, they can alert you to it right away. This smaller crack can be repaired much more cheaply than a full rebuild of a chimney would be.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t hesitate to <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/contact-us/">contact us</a> if you haven&#8217;t had your chimney looked at in awhile. Don&#8217;t wait until the problem is a dangerous one.</p>
