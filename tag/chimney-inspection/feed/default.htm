				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The threat of carbon monoxide poisoning can happen in your home. A scary thought? Neglecting regular chimney maintenance can result in carbon monoxide leaking into your home without you even realize it. Odorless, tasteless, and invisible, this toxic gas can even become trapped within your house. If you do not have a carbon monoxide alarm installed to alert you, you and your family could fall prey to illness or death from continuously inhaling large amounts of this gas. To be even safer from the dangers of carbon monoxide poisoning, an annual chimney sweeping and inspection from a Chimney Safety Institute of America (CSIA)-certified company like Ashbusters can stop this gas from becoming a problem. We would like to inform you about these dangers so that you can protect yourself and your family.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/carbon-monoxide-dangers-nashville-tn-ashbusters.jpg" class="highslide" onclick="return hs.expand(this)"  title="Carbon Monoxide - Nashville TN - Ashbusters"><img class="alignright wp-image-3478 size-medium" title="Carbon Monoxide - Nashville TN - Ashbusters" src="http://www.ashbusters.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/carbon-monoxide-dangers-nashville-tn-ashbusters-297x350.jpg" alt="Carbon Monoxide - Nashville TN - Ashbusters" width="297" height="350" /></a></p>
<h3>How Does Carbon Monoxide Affect My Body?</h3>
<p>When you breathe in carbon monoxide, the poisonous gas enters your bloodstream. What your blood naturally does with this gas is the true danger. Hemoglobin, a protein in your blood, chooses to pick up and carry the carbon monoxide and to ignore oxygen. Of course, we need oxygen flowing through our bloodstreams to keep our cells from suffocating. The amount of damage caused depends on how long and how intensely you are exposed to inhaling carbon monoxide.</p>
<h3>How Common Are Deaths and Illnesses Due to Carbon Monoxide Poisoning?</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.csia.org/homeowner-resources/Avoiding_Carbon_Monoxide_Hazards.aspx" target="_blank">According to the CSIA</a>, at least 200 people in the U.S. are killed every year from carbon monoxide poisoning caused by venting problems in their heating systems. Approximately 10,000 cases of sickness related to carbon monoxide are recorded each year as well.</p>
<h3>What are the Side-Effects and Symptoms of Carbon Monoxide Poisoning?</h3>
<p>Side-effects of low-level exposure can include permanent brain and other organ damage. Unfortunately, the symptoms of low-level poisoning are much like those of the common cold: headache, dizziness, fatigue, and nausea. This causes many misdiagnoses of carbon monoxide poisoning, which prolongs the exposure. If these symptoms do not go away, be persistent with your doctor and ask for a blood test to check for levels of this toxic gas. The sooner high levels are found, the sooner life-saving treatment can begin.</p>
<h3>How Does This Gas Enter My House?</h3>
<p>Poor ventilation is the primary cause of carbon monoxide coming into your home; however, the factors behind the venting problems include a damaged or missing chimney flue liner, large deposits of creosote, debris clogging the passageway, and nesting from birds or other animals blocking the flue.</p>
<h3>How Can I Stop Carbon Monoxide from Entering My Home?</h3>
<p>All of the factors behind chimney ventilation problems can be corrected with an annual chimney sweeping and inspection from Ashbusters. With cases of carbon monoxide-related health issues on the rise, our CSIA-certified chimney sweeps will clean out any blockages, check flue liners for damaging cracks, and replace a deteriorated chimney liner to protect you from the dangers of carbon monoxide poisoning.</p>
<p>If you have not scheduled your annual chimney sweeping and inspection this year, contact Ashbusters today. Our staff will arrange a chimney sweep visit to your home as soon as possible.</p>

The same holds true for your chimney masonry. Spalling is one thing that can happen to it.</p></div>
<h3>What Is Spalling?</h3>
<p>All kinds of crazy things can happen to your chimney masonry. One look at our <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/services/chimney-repairs/chimneys-gone-wild/" target="_blank">Chimneys Gone Wild</a> page [link to ] will show you that.</p>
<p>One of the problems that Ashbusters sees most often with chimney brick in Nashville is something called “spalling.” Spalling can afflict just about any sort of stone surface; patios, walkways, and pool decks are also prone to spalling. Spalling bricks may be found both on both the inside and outside of your chimney. Only a professional chimney inspection will reveal whether or not the brick inside your chimney is in good shape. In fact, we would only recommend hiring a chimney technician—rather than a brick mason—to repair your chimney brick, as chimneys face specific problems and serve purposes that only a C.S.I.A. [www.csia.org] trained sweep will be able to properly address.</p>
<h3>How can I tell if my chimney is spalling?</h3>
<p>You will be able to identify a spalling problem if it looks like the face of your chimney brick, even a small portion of it, has popped off or is flaking off.</p>
<h3>Why is my chimney spalling?</h3>
<p>This is brick’s natural response to water intrusion and to the freeze/thaw cycle. Brick and mortar can unfortunately be quite porous if not protected, and water damage will only grow worse over time. The good news though is that there are plenty of ways to safeguard brick from this kind of damage in the future.</p>
<h3>Can you fix my spalling brick?</h3>
<p>Absolutely. Ashbusters handles a wide variety of <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/services/chimney-repairs/chimney-masonry/" target="_blank">masonry repairs</a>. In most cases, if we find that the interior of your chimney is spalling or cracking, we will recommend that you reline it or use a chimney resurfacing system that will fill in any gaps, making your chimney safe for use again. If your exterior brick is spalling, we will replace the damaged bricks and mortar. We can also tuckpoint to fill in any mortar gaps.</p>
<h3>Can you protect my brick so it doesn’t spall again?</h3>
<p>Yes, we highly recommend a service called chimney waterproofing. It is a good idea to waterproof your chimney after you have had spalling problems or other masonry repairs taken care of; this will seal your repair work for the next decade at least.</p>
<p>Do you have a chimney in need of repair? Call Ashbusters today!</p>

Be aware of the common causes of a leaky chimney so you can help prevent it.</p></div>
<p>Unfortunately, when you have a masonry chimney, sooner or later, it is going to leak. According to the <a href="http://www.csia.org/homeowner-resources/water_and_your_masonry_chimney.aspx" target="_blank">Chimney Safety Institute of America</a> (CSIA), water is your masonry chimney’s biggest enemy. This is due in large part to the fact that the outer part of your chimney is exposed to rain, moisture and the elements, which leads to water penetrating the porous brickwork and mortar of your chimney. This water penetration causes extensive and expensive damage, ranging from rusted fireplace and chimney parts to rotted wood and stained walls and ceilings; extreme cases can even result in moderate to severe chimney structural damage.</p>
<p>You believe you have protected your chimney from water penetration and cannot seem to figure out what is causing your chimney to leak? The CSIA-certified chimney technicians at Ashbusters are experienced at finding the point of origin of chimney<a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/services/chimney-repairs/chimney-leaks/" target="_blank"> leaks</a>, determining what is causing the leak, and repairing the leak, along with any damage it has caused to your chimney and fireplace.</p>
<p>As chimney leaks are difficult to pinpoint, it is helpful to know their main causes. To give you a better idea of where you should focus your attention, the home improvement website, Improvenet by CraftJack, provides the following common sources of chimney leaks:</p>
<h3>1. The Mortar Crown or Chimney Cap</h3>
<p>If the mortar around the top of your chimney begins to crack and crumble, or if you have a damaged chimney cap with cracks and chips, rainwater is leaking into your chimney from the very top. Since both bricks and mortar are porous, water can be absorbed into your chimney walls and leads to gradual deterioration from within. The solution to this problem is simple, and Ashbusters can help you in selecting and installing a new <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/catalog/chimney-caps/" target="_blank">chimney cap</a> or creating and installing a customized <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/services/chimney-repairs/chimney-masonry/" target="_blank">masonry</a> chimney crown and repairing the damaged bricks and mortar around it.</p>
<h3>2. Deteriorating Mortar Joints</h3>
<p>When mortar joints age and erode, holes develop, and water has another passageway through which to enter the chimney. The amount and size of these holes can and will vary and can become large enough to allow a sizable amount of water in during a heavy rain. Even if the hole is small, water can still seep into the joint, travel to a hole in the brick, and maneuver its way down the chimney. Ashbusters can save the day with our years of masonry and solve this problem by repointing the deteriorated mortar joints with new mortar.</p>
<h3>3. Flashing</h3>
<p>Your flashing, the metal sheeting that protects the area where your chimney meets your roof, is a common place for water to penetrate your chimney. Even if it looks like it is securely covering the area around your chimney, it only takes one tiny hole for water to enter the chimney. The best solution to this problem is to have your flashing professionally re-fitted and installed. We at Ashbusters are experienced with building complete <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/services/chimney-repairs/chimney-masonry/" target="_blank">masonry chimneys</a>, so our CSIA-certified technicians can take care of this flashing job for you.</p>
<h3>4. The Roof Shingles Around the Chimney</h3>
<p>This is the least common cause for a chimney leak, but if the experts at Ashbusters cannot find the leak in the other 3 areas or anywhere else, you more than likely have damaged and/or loose roof shingles. To solve this problem, you will need to call a roofing expert to diagnose this problem and repair it by replacing the shingles.</p>
<p>If you suspect you have a leaky chimney, do not hesitate to <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/contact-us/" target="_blank">contact</a> Ashbusters today. We will find the leak and repair your problem quickly.</p>

<p>Having a chimney in your home is more than just having cozy warm nights with a rustic ambiance. It also entails a lot of responsibility and keen observational skills on your end, especially if you want to ensure your chimney’s functionality as well as your family’s safety.</p>
<p>More often than not, our team at <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/" target="_blank">Ashbusters Chimney Service</a> get approached by homeowners presenting concerns or asking certain things and issues about their chimneys. One of the most asked questions is regarding their chimney draft.</p>
<p><strong><em>So, here’s a short reference that has everything you would need to know about chimney drafts:</em></strong></p>
<h3>What is a chimney draft?</h3>
<p>The chimney draft, or simply called the draft, is the pulling action in your chimney caused by the negative pressure mechanism that’s at play inside each and every one of your chimneys. You see, your chimney produces hot air. When the heat generated inside the chimney reaches a certain level, it starts to pull air through the firebox, and thus, the draft.</p>
<h3>How will you be able to identify a draft problem?</h3>
<p>This is relatively easy to spot. All you need to watch out for are the 3 cardinal signs that are indicative of a chimney draft problem. First, you need to observe the air inside your home. If air begins to enter your home from your chimney, then that’s a sign that something is definitely wrong. Second, when you have unusual trying to start a fire or keep it burning, that’s another sign. And lastly, if you notice a smokey smell around your house even without a fire burning, then that’s definitely a warning sign.</p>
<h3>How does it affect us?</h3>
<p>Initially or in minute cases, draft problems don’t really pose that much of a threat to us. But according to the C<a href="http://www.csia.org/" target="_blank">himney Safety Institute of America</a>, in worst case scenarios it may turn your home into a risky living environment by becoming a fire and health hazard. Carbon monoxide poisoning can easily occur due to improper draft.</p>
<h3>What can we do?</h3>
<p>The best and smartest thing to do is to contact a <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/contact-us/" target="_blank">chimney expert</a> to check your chimney as soon as possible. Not only will they be able to point out damages and risks, but they would also help you in setting up preventive measure as to avoid dreadful and horrible scenarios from ever occurring.</p>
<p>Chimney draft problems are more common than you think. For all you know you have one going on in your home at this very moment. So what are you waiting for? Pick up the phone or open your computers and set an appointment as soon as you can.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A functional and high performing chimney is a fantastic addition to your home…especially during these cold months. But, to safely enjoy, it is recommended that you have a chimney <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/services/sweeping/" target="_blank">sweep</a> and <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/services/inspections/" target="_blank">inspection</a> every year. Without proper usage of your chimney, it can become unsafe for you and your family.

<h3>What is Carbon Monoxide?</h3>
<p>Carbon Monoxide is an odorless, colorless gas that is extremely toxic. Once it enters the bloodstream, it begins to compete with the current oxygen levels. CO can be released into the air by using everyday appliances, such as generators, vehicles, and also your fireplace. If you are around one of these, make sure the area you are in is open. If the appliance has a vent, arrange where the fumes go outside. Lastly, never use something to heat your home that is not intended for that purpose, such as a gas oven, and do not leave other heating methods unattended or on overnight.</p>
<h3>How can you prevent carbon monoxide from getting in the air?</h3>
<p>Chimney draft is important when talking about carbon monoxide because if the draft cannot appropriately pull air through the home and out for the chimney, it will remain in the home. You can adjust the draft pressure by changing the heat of the fire or changing the physical structure of the chimney.</p>
<h3>Reasons draft is compromised</h3>
<p>Often times a draft’s flow can be disrupted. One of the most common and avoidable reasons is an abundance of creosote build up inside of the chimney. Creosotes are combustion particles released as firewood is burned that clump together as the make their way up the chimney. This is one of the reasons you should always make sure your chimney sweep is<a href="http://www.csia.org/homeowner-resources/how_to_hire_a_chimney_sweep.aspx" target="_blank"> Chimney Safety Institute of America</a> (CSIA) certified. CSIA has a list of set guidelines they use to ensure that you appointment is worth your time and will keep you safe. Other things that could cause draft problems include clogged dampers and dirty chimney caps.</p>
<h3>Other sources of potential trouble</h3>
<p>Other than draft problems, carbon monoxide can build up when other equipment is consuming the same clean air that is being vented within the house. If you use exhaust fans when you’re using a fuel-burning heater or stove, only run the fans for a few minutes at a time. Prolonged usage could remove too much air and waste heat. Also, do not run any power attic vents during the winter. When a fireplace or woodstove is running, open a window and turn off anything that releases warm air. You can also try replacing the air duct that connects to the fireplace so it does not steal air from your furnace.</p>
<h3>How can I protect my family?</h3>
<p>Now companies have invented CO alarms that you can install in your home to be alerted if levels in the area become dangerous. To get the best results, spread multiple alarms throughout the home, especially if there are multiple levels or an open floor plan. Some systems are built where you can connect them so that when one sounds they all go off. These alarms should be used with smoke detectors, not instead of, and should be tested periodically.</p>
<h3>What does CO poisoning feel like and how is it treated?</h3>
<p>Because of the state of carbon monoxide, people cannot tell when it begins to fill a room. This is detrimental to a person’s health because they will intake more than their body can handle before they even realize it. There are differing levels of symptoms you can have depending on how much of the gas you take in. Mild symptoms are flulike and include nausea, dizziness, headache, and fatigue, while the more severe symptoms can lead to fatality. If someone in your home has a medical condition they may react differently or more quickly, while people with heart and breathing conditions will begin to experience chest pain.</p>
<p>If you or the people around you begin to feel these symptoms, you should evacuate the area immediately, even if you cannot get to whatever is releasing the gas to turn it off. You should also seek immediate medical attention. Patients who have had minimal exposure should be able to be treated in office, but in extreme cases they may have to be admitted into a hospital to receive oxygen to normalize levels.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some homeowners today are choosing to use <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/catalog/fireplaces-and-stoves/contemporary-gas-fireplaces/">pre-fabricated, or factory-built, fireplaces</a>. Instead of being built and tested separately, these units are constructed and tested together to ensure safety and workability. In some cases, the existing foundation supplies ample support for the fireplace, as they are much lighter than a fireplace constructed purely of masonry.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2243" title="Ashbusters Chimney Service can install pre-fabricated fireplaces in your home." alt="Ashbusters Chimney Service can install pre-fabricated fireplaces in your home." src="http://www.ashbusters.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/ashbusters-prefab-fireplace-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" /></p>
<p>Safety during use must be a major concern for homeowners. You should observe the same safety rules you would use for a masonry fireplace.</p>
<ul>
<li>Always leave damper open when fireplace is in use.</li>
<li>Use a fireplace screen to prevent sparks from leaving the fireplace.</li>
<li>Avoid using wet or green wood, as well as overloading the fireplace. Doing so may cause the pile to collapse, resulting in logs rolling out of the fireplace.</li>
<li>Do not use accelerants to ignite fire.</li>
<li>Burning excessive paper or Christmas tree branches can cause damage to interior of chimney.</li>
<li>NEVER install a wood stove in a pre-fabricated fireplace and chimney. They are not designed for this type of use.</li>
<li>Have the fireplace and chimney inspected annually.</li>
</ul>
<p>One advantage of using a pre-fabricated fireplace is in the fact that it can be placed much closer to combustible materials than a regular fireplace. This presents homeowners with a much wider selection of choices and placement in their homes.</p>
<p>While the homeowner may select a traditional design, they will also have the option of choosing something more modern. While a wood stove is not permitted, adjustments can be made to a pre-fabricated fireplace to allow for placement of a gas log. However, ventless logs should not be used unless the fireplace manufacturer specifically states this type of log is acceptable. If this is the case, the damper is left open and the vent free set up is treated in the manner as a gas fireplace needing full venting.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Homeowners who have fireplaces love sitting in front of them on those cold, wintry nights. However, before enjoying the benefits of a fireplace, they need to make sure it is safe to use. Early fall is the perfect time to schedule chimney inspection. Doing so can prevent such things as carbon monoxide poisoning and fires.</p>
<p>When You Should Have Your Fireplace Inspected:</p>
<ul>
<li>New Home Owners &#8211; if you are just moving into your home, it is a good idea to have the fireplace inspected. It is far too risky to take the previous homeowners word that the chimney has been inspected. Have it done yourself just to be sure.</li>
<li>Summer &#8211; as mentioned above, this is the ideal time for an inspection. The chimney will get regular usage and it needs to be cleaned before it is fired up again. The usage from the previous season could have created creosote buildup as well as debris accumulating in the chimney over the course of the spring and summer. In addition, there is the danger of animals nesting in the chimney while it was not in use.</li>
<li>Buildup &#8211; this is a sure sign the chimney needs to be cleaned. Excessive usage will create a creosote buildup. Experts say that as little as one eighth of an inch is enough to cause a house fire.</li>
<li>Gas Fireplaces &#8211; some individuals are under the impression that since they are using a gas fireplace that they need not worry about having their chimney cleaned, but that is far from the truth. There is still the danger of obstructions in the chimney that could cause a fire hazard.</li>
<li>Improper Heating &#8211; when a homeowner notices their home is not being properly warmed by the fireplace, this is a warning sign that something could be wrong. Smoke return or odd smells could mean there is a buildup or blockage in the chimney. If this is the case, do not use it at all until it has been inspected and cleaned by an expert.</li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Long ago, it was believed that if storks started nesting in your chimneys they would bring good fortune to the homeowner. However, actually, the only luck these stork nests bring you is bad luck. Logically, any kind of blockage in your chimney is bad news. These nesting hindrances will give you a lot of headaches, and can lead to a house fire if not remedied. Once your chimney gets blocked, you can face numerous problems such as chimney fires, dangerous smoking situations, and carbon monoxide poisoning.</p>
<p>According to the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission, there were at least 18,300 fires that were caused by chimneys. The fires cost $160 million in property damages, and left 160 injured and 40 dead. The <a href="http://www.csia.org/" target="_blank">Chimney Safety Institute of America</a> commented that these residential fires would have been prevented if homeowners had been more concerned about their chimneys. The National Fire Protection Association recommends that homeowners should conduct yearly chimney inspections to avoid potential fire hazards.</p>
<p>The common misconception that homeowners have about their chimneys is that they believe that their chimneys should only be cleaned if they burn wood. It is concerning that a lot of homeowners clean their basements, garages, and roof gutters, and they neglect to take time to inspect and make repairs for their chimneys. They are taking a great risk by not looking after their chimneys. If homeowners fail to check their chimneys, the possibility of carbon monoxide poisoning will go up. You can buy a carbon monoxide detector to check the carbon monoxide levels in your living room, but you should also have your chimney inspected regularly.</p>
<p>The importance of a well maintained chimney cannot be overstated. You will save you and your family from a potentially tragic situation by simply having these regular chimney checkups.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The holidays are here. In most parts of the country, this is the time for family and friends gathering around the fireplace. After all, it is one of those iconic activities during the holidays. Many carols are sung that talk about the joys of sitting in front of an open fire. You definitely don&#8217;t want those types of memories to be marred by a house fire. Believe me, this is a highly personal issue for us at Ashbusters.</p>
<p>Mark Stoner, the founder of <a title="Our Team" href="http://www.ashbusters.net/about-us/our-team/">Ashbusters</a>, had a terrible holiday experience with a chimney that ended up in a house fire. In fact, that experience was one of the chief reasons he started working as a chimney sweep. He did not want anyone to go through a holiday season having to deal with a house fire. So, we always want to do more than perform chimney services for our customers. We also want to educate them about best practices for their chimney.</p>
<p>The first thing to consider is when the last time your chimney was inspected. Regular chimney inspections can turn up a host of potential fire hazards and chimney damage. You should think about it like you think about maintaining a car. When you don&#8217;t have necessary maintenance like oil changes performed, your car will cost much more in the long run to fix. Similarly, these chimney inspections turn up small issues that can be fixed before they become much larger issues.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t put off having your chimney inspected. It could end up being a very expensive repair, or much worse. The last thing you want your family to experience this holiday season is a chimney fire. We will be glad to schedule an appointment to take a look at your chimney. We can make sure it will be safe this entire holiday and winter season.</p>
