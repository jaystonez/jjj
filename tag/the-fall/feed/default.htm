				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wow!  You might be saying since it’s the first week in August. However, you&#8217;ll turn around and the kids will be back in school, Labor Day will be long since past and Thanksgiving will be right around the corner. I know this because it happens to me every year!</p>
<p>Another thing happens to me as well, I forget there are a few things that are “must do’s” before the cold sets in and one of those will insure the very life of my family! So why is it so easy to forget about getting the <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/services/sweeping/">chimney cleaned</a>? I have decided it’s one of those “out of sight out of mind” things but this year it’s different.</p>
<p>My wife and I established a home calendar at the beginning of the year on Google. If you don’t know how to do it its really easy and you can find out more about it <a href="www.google.com/calendar" target="_blank">here</a>. On this calendar you are able to color code so we have a color that highlights family and friend’s birthdays, another one for functions we are attending and then we have a RED color that is for things that have to be done; no questions asked. It is here that at the end of August we have listed; call Ashbusters and get the chimney swept.</p>
<p>We always ask them to <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/services/dryer-vent-cleaning/">clean the dryer vent</a> when they’re out to the house as well so I know that two of the most important things on my list to keep my family safe and healthy will be done every year. But don’t take my word for it, go and do the research yourself so the information will stick. You will be amazed how many fires are caused by these two hazards in your home, not to mention the poisoning effects from smoke that can seep into your home in places you will never see.</p>
<p>The most important thing to remember is not to forget to get this done on an annual basis; and don’t leave it to chance. Set up a reminder now on your home calendar or Smart Phone. You and your family will be glad you did!</p>
