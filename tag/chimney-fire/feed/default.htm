Make sure your chimney is always clean.</p></div>
<p>If you have a chimney, chances are you have had something stuck inside it at some point. A chimney blockage can be a dangerous situation; as stated by the <a href="http://www.csia.org/homeowner-resources/the_facts_about_chimney_fires.aspx" target="_blank">Chimney Safety Institute of America</a> (CSIA), a dirty chimney can cause a chimney fire. One of the main reasons an annual <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/services/sweeping/" target="_blank">chimney sweep</a> is so important, proper maintenance of your chimney prevents your chimney from blockages as everything is cleaned out and removed in the chimney sweep process. We at Ashbusters provide the best chimney sweep in town, and our CSIA-certified technicians will remove the following common chimney blockages when they are stuck in your chimney.</p>
<h3>Animals</h3>
<p>When the cold weather comes, animals like birds, squirrels, and raccoons come looking for a warm place to nest for the winter, and your chimney may become a chosen home. This can create a very perilous situation as not only could it cause a dangerous fire if you light a fire while the animal is inside your chimney, but if the animal becomes stuck, it could die, leaving it to spread foul, putrid fumes through your house. You should never try to remove a wild animal from a chimney yourself. Always call professionals like Ashbusters. We are <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/services/sweeping/" target="_blank">qualified</a> with removing animal debris, and if need be, we can contact a professional animal remover if an animal is still alive.</p>
<h3>Debris</h3>
<p>Even though you may have a chimney cap, leaves, trash, and settlement still seem to get into your chimney and accumulate. After a period of time, this accumulation can cause a blockage large enough to cause incomplete combustion and negative air pressure, driving smoke back into your house. Also, if you allow settlement to build up long enough, it causes cracks in your flue, and then you will have dangerous, poisonous carbon monoxide leaking into your house.</p>
<h3>Creosote</h3>
<p>If you have a wood-burning stove, you have creosote deposits building up on the walls of your chimney, and if you go too long without a chimney sweeping, creosote can build up large enough to be a hazardous blockage. According to the <a href="http://www.csia.org/homeowner-resources/the_facts_about_chimney_fires.aspx" target="_blank">CSIA</a>, creosote is formed naturally in the wood-burning process. When the by-products of combustion (smoke, vapors, tar fog, gases, hyrdocarbon, unburned wood particles, etc) exit your fireplace and go out your cooler chimney, condensation occurs, and the result is creosote residue. Black or brown in appearance, creosote can be sticky and tar-like, shiny and hardened, or crusty and flaky, but no matter what it looks like, it is a dangerous, highly-combustible compound that is the leading cause of chimney fires. Luckily, your annual <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/services/sweeping/" target="_blank">chimney sweep</a> will take care of all of the creosote build-up in your chimney. The CSIA-certified chimney sweeps at Ashbusters are highly trained to remove all creosote deposits from your chimney, making it safe from chimney fires.</p>
<p>Although, the “something is stuck in my chimney!” situation sounds dire and can be an emergency, there is a simple solution: <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/contact-us/" target="_blank">contact</a> Ashbusters today for a professional chimney sweep to get the blockage out of your chimney and safely enjoy your fireplace again.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;" align="center"><b>Helpful Tips for Your Emergency Escape Plan</b></p>
<p>Every day a lot of undetermined circumstances happen. Some days, you’re okay; doing your usual routine and some days you are literally fighting for your life and going through an unexpected ordeal. We cannot control these events from occurring. We just have to be prepared for it when it happens.</p>
<p>Fires can start with a spark and end in a horrifying scenario. In 2012, over 370,000 homes were burnt to the ground and over 3,000 died in that year. This can be caused by a lot of things; candles, short-circuit, tangled wires, and it does not end there. This is why developing an escape plan for your home is mandatory. Especially if you have kids and old people in your home, it’s best to prepare for this kind of scenario. Better safe than sorry, right?</p>
<div id="attachment_3109" style="width: 203px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Escape-Plan-Tips-Nashville-TN-Ashbusters.jpg" class="highslide" onclick="return hs.expand(this)" ><img class="size-medium wp-image-3109" alt="Want your family to be prepared to escape safely in case of a fire? Educate, develop and practice, practice, practice. " src="http://www.ashbusters.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Escape-Plan-Tips-Nashville-TN-Ashbusters-193x300.jpg" width="193" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Want your family to be prepared to escape safely in case of a fire? Educate, develop and practice, practice, practice.</p></div>
<p>For a more prepared approach in your emergency escape plan, you have to remember these eight helpful tips:</p>
<ol>
<li>Always make sure that when you’re designing your escape plan, everyone living in the home is present. This can help them identify all the things they need to know once the situation has taken place. This can also help your family gauge everyone’s physical conditions, sleeping habits and the like.</li>
<li>Whether in a one storey or to storey house, make sure there are interconnected smoke alarms. Preferably in every room and area. Make sure that this is set at maximum volume so everyone can hear.</li>
<li>The escape routes should not have anything blocking or covering it so that there would be ease when people need to run towards the outside. The windows and doors should be easy-to-open as well. This can be easier for people in their golden years to be accompanied by another young person to carefully but briskly walk towards the exit points.</li>
<li>Make sure that your street number is visible enough for fire fighters to see. This can help them find and reach you quickly, as well as put out the fire immediately. Have everyone memorize the number of the fire department so that anyone can do the calling.</li>
<li>Your escape plan must include an outside meeting place; where everyone can meet up once they are already outside the house. You can regroup there and organize yourselves to avoid panic.</li>
<li>For two-storey houses, make sure that there are portable ladders near windows so if the fire has already blazed in the first floor, you can use the ladder to safety.</li>
<li>Do fire drills at least twice a year. Use your smoke alarms to also check if everyone can hear it clearly.</li>
<li>You can establish a timeline for the elderly and their assistant to make their way out. This can also prepare your family for real live fires.</li>
</ol>
<p>Fires can be a result of chimney blockages as well as fireplace negligence. This can trigger the loss of your home in just a matter of minutes. For a worry-free home and a <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/services/chimney-repairs/" target="_blank">clean fireplace and chimney</a>, call upon the certified chimney sweeps of Ashbusters Chimney Service. They have been in the business for over 25 years and continue to please their customers. They are equipped with the right amount of skill and knowledge that will prevent fires to happen in your home. They can also teach you how to develop an effective escape plan. Your safety is their priority.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The holidays are here. In most parts of the country, this is the time for family and friends gathering around the fireplace. After all, it is one of those iconic activities during the holidays. Many carols are sung that talk about the joys of sitting in front of an open fire. You definitely don&#8217;t want those types of memories to be marred by a house fire. Believe me, this is a highly personal issue for us at Ashbusters.</p>
<p>Mark Stoner, the founder of <a title="Our Team" href="http://www.ashbusters.net/about-us/our-team/">Ashbusters</a>, had a terrible holiday experience with a chimney that ended up in a house fire. In fact, that experience was one of the chief reasons he started working as a chimney sweep. He did not want anyone to go through a holiday season having to deal with a house fire. So, we always want to do more than perform chimney services for our customers. We also want to educate them about best practices for their chimney.</p>
<p>The first thing to consider is when the last time your chimney was inspected. Regular chimney inspections can turn up a host of potential fire hazards and chimney damage. You should think about it like you think about maintaining a car. When you don&#8217;t have necessary maintenance like oil changes performed, your car will cost much more in the long run to fix. Similarly, these chimney inspections turn up small issues that can be fixed before they become much larger issues.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t put off having your chimney inspected. It could end up being a very expensive repair, or much worse. The last thing you want your family to experience this holiday season is a chimney fire. We will be glad to schedule an appointment to take a look at your chimney. We can make sure it will be safe this entire holiday and winter season.</p>
