				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We started Ashbusters in 1985 on the notion that there was a better way to do business. We wanted to make sure everyone loved our work, and we hoped everyone felt they had received great value for their dollar. All these years later, it feels like people have gotten the message. We serve the entire Middle Tennessee area, and this summer, we opened a <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/locations/south-carolina-locations/charleston-sc/">new location in Charleston, South Carolina</a>.</p>
<p>In Middle Tennessee, some of the areas we service include the west Nashville communities of Bellevue, Belle Meade and Green Hills. These older areas of town are known for their beautiful older homes, with some new ones mixed in. Older constructions weren&#8217;t always built with fire safety in mind. The dryer vents could stretch completely across the house, meaning you are going to need a good dryer vent cleaning to reach all the way across. This also is the case for the beautiful older homes that make up Nashville&#8217;s oldest residential community, East Nashville.</p>
<p>We have two office locations in Tennessee, one of which is in Smyrna. This wonderful little town on the outskirts of Nashville is the Middle Tennessee home to Ashbusters. We have been preaching to the community the importance of regular chimney cleanings the entire time. The best way to keep your family safe is to make sure that your chimney is clean and operational. Cracks in the mortar can put you in danger of having a house fire.</p>
<p>We also have long tried to stay active in our community. After all, you are the reason we are in business at all. We want you to know exactly how important you are to us. If you ever have any questions, please <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/contact-us/">contact us</a>. Also, if you want to read more about our <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/locations/">service locations</a>, we talk in depth about each area of town. Thanks for all the years of supporting our business, and we look forward to serving you much more in the future.</p>
