<p>When you’re new to fireplace or stove ownership, there are a few key things that you’ll need to learn straight away. One of those things: proper burning practices, like using only seasoned or kiln-dried firewood in your<a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/catalog/fireplaces-and-stoves/wood-fireplaces/" target="_blank"> wood-burning appliance</a>, and making sure your damper is completely open before you start a fire. Another: the need for regular maintenance — including annual chimney inspection  and chimney sweeping  appointments — to keep your system running efficiently and effectively. And along with those basics, you’ll want to know why you’re doing all that.</p>
<p>The answer to the latter, in a lot of cases, is creosote. If you’re not familiar with creosote, using a hearth appliance quickly makes you become familiar with it — it’s a constant part of using a wood-burning appliance. Want to know more? Here’s a quick creosote F.A.Q.</p>
<p><strong>How Do I Know If There’s Creosote In My Chimney?</strong></p>
<div id="attachment_3315" style="width: 299px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Creosote-F.A.Q.-Nashville-TN-Ashbusters.jpg" class="highslide" onclick="return hs.expand(this)" ><img class="size-medium wp-image-3315" src="http://www.ashbusters.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Creosote-F.A.Q.-Nashville-TN-Ashbusters-289x300.jpg" alt="Ignoring annual chimney cleanings and inspections can be dangerous to your home and your family. Let us help you minimize your risks. " width="289" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Ignoring annual chimney cleanings and inspections can be dangerous to your home and your family. Let us help you minimize your risks.</p></div>
<p>Unlike some other byproducts of combustion — like colorless and odorless carbon monoxide — creosote makes itself known. You may smell a smoky odor coming from your chimney that indicates creosote’s presence, or you might see creosote deposits around your flue opening. Depending on the level of creosote you have (levels 1, 2 an 3 are how hearth professionals categorize the progression of creosote residue), it might look powdery and velvety, crunchy and flaky, thick and drippy or hard and shiny, in colors ranging from brown to black.</p>
<p>But really, here’s the underlying truth about whether or not there’s creosote in your chimney: If you’ve been burning wood in your fireplace or stove, there’s creosote in your chimney. Its development is a natural part of burning wood. The combustion of wood creates a mix of byproducts — including smoke, small particles, tar fog and gases — that rise up the chimney and meet the cooler flue walls, condensing into a liquid. That liquid residue is creosote, and it layers and thickens over time and with use of your appliance.</p>
<p><strong>Can I Stop Creosote From Forming?</strong></p>
<p>You can’t prevent creosote development, but you can use some smart burning practices to limit its build-up. They include the ones we mentioned above — using properly dried wood, and opening your damper completely. Those practices help you develop a fire that’s burning hot enough to encourage proper draft and effective venting.</p>
<p><strong>If Creosote Is So Common, Why Do I Need To Be Concerned About It?</strong></p>
<p>Excessive creosote brings a grab bag of problems along with it. First, there’s the fact that creosote is highly combustible — so the more creosote is lining your flue, the higher the chances of a fire hazard become.</p>
<p>Creosote can also affect your chimney’s ability to vent effectively — if it thickens considerably on your flue walls, it can minimize your chimney’s draft, or even block your flue.</p>
<p><strong>How Do I Get Rid Of Creosote?</strong></p>
<p>On your end, all you need to do to ensure proper creosote removal is to give Ashbusters Chimney Service a call and schedule a <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/services/sweeping/" target="_blank">chimney sweeping  appointment</a>. Our CSIA-certified sweeps use specially designed brushes and tools and a vacuum system with a triple layer HEPA filter to make sure that your flue walls are free of creosote, and your home is free of dust. When professional chimney sweeping is done annually, you can expect your chimney to vent better, longer — and you can rest easy knowing that you’re not leaving a potential fire hazard uncorrected.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about creosote — or want to schedule a chimney sweeping appointment — give Ashbusters a call. We’d love to help you enjoy a clean and well-performing chimney!</p>

Make sure your chimney is always clean.</p></div>
<p>If you have a chimney, chances are you have had something stuck inside it at some point. A chimney blockage can be a dangerous situation; as stated by the <a href="http://www.csia.org/homeowner-resources/the_facts_about_chimney_fires.aspx" target="_blank">Chimney Safety Institute of America</a> (CSIA), a dirty chimney can cause a chimney fire. One of the main reasons an annual <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/services/sweeping/" target="_blank">chimney sweep</a> is so important, proper maintenance of your chimney prevents your chimney from blockages as everything is cleaned out and removed in the chimney sweep process. We at Ashbusters provide the best chimney sweep in town, and our CSIA-certified technicians will remove the following common chimney blockages when they are stuck in your chimney.</p>
<h3>Animals</h3>
<p>When the cold weather comes, animals like birds, squirrels, and raccoons come looking for a warm place to nest for the winter, and your chimney may become a chosen home. This can create a very perilous situation as not only could it cause a dangerous fire if you light a fire while the animal is inside your chimney, but if the animal becomes stuck, it could die, leaving it to spread foul, putrid fumes through your house. You should never try to remove a wild animal from a chimney yourself. Always call professionals like Ashbusters. We are <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/services/sweeping/" target="_blank">qualified</a> with removing animal debris, and if need be, we can contact a professional animal remover if an animal is still alive.</p>
<h3>Debris</h3>
<p>Even though you may have a chimney cap, leaves, trash, and settlement still seem to get into your chimney and accumulate. After a period of time, this accumulation can cause a blockage large enough to cause incomplete combustion and negative air pressure, driving smoke back into your house. Also, if you allow settlement to build up long enough, it causes cracks in your flue, and then you will have dangerous, poisonous carbon monoxide leaking into your house.</p>
<h3>Creosote</h3>
<p>If you have a wood-burning stove, you have creosote deposits building up on the walls of your chimney, and if you go too long without a chimney sweeping, creosote can build up large enough to be a hazardous blockage. According to the <a href="http://www.csia.org/homeowner-resources/the_facts_about_chimney_fires.aspx" target="_blank">CSIA</a>, creosote is formed naturally in the wood-burning process. When the by-products of combustion (smoke, vapors, tar fog, gases, hyrdocarbon, unburned wood particles, etc) exit your fireplace and go out your cooler chimney, condensation occurs, and the result is creosote residue. Black or brown in appearance, creosote can be sticky and tar-like, shiny and hardened, or crusty and flaky, but no matter what it looks like, it is a dangerous, highly-combustible compound that is the leading cause of chimney fires. Luckily, your annual <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/services/sweeping/" target="_blank">chimney sweep</a> will take care of all of the creosote build-up in your chimney. The CSIA-certified chimney sweeps at Ashbusters are highly trained to remove all creosote deposits from your chimney, making it safe from chimney fires.</p>
<p>Although, the “something is stuck in my chimney!” situation sounds dire and can be an emergency, there is a simple solution: <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/contact-us/" target="_blank">contact</a> Ashbusters today for a professional chimney sweep to get the blockage out of your chimney and safely enjoy your fireplace again.</p>

<p>Have you heard about creosote? If your home has a chimney, then you should! No, it’s not some kind of fancy delicacy, although it could sound like it. Creosote is inevitable to any chimney, but it doesn’t mean that it’s something you want to have accumulating in the flue.</p>
<h3>What is Creosote and Why Get Rid of it?</h3>
<p>Creosote is actually one of those chemical by products from burning wood that clings to the inside if your chimney. Generally, a small amount of it will always be present in any chimney with an active fireplace. However, it should not be left unattended or taken too lightly because creosote build-up could be very dangerous. In particular, it will have three levels of build-up, each of which has their own hazards. But the greatest danger of all regarding creosote build-up is the likelihood of developing chimney fires because creosote is flammable. Many times, these fires will go unnoticed within the chimney and further lead to more and more build-up causing a blockage that will interfere with the flow of air out the chimney. This will eventually lead to a dangerous case of carbon monoxide accumulation which is highly toxic. So you can just imagine the myriad of unfortunate events that could stem from unwanted creosote lingering up the chimney flue.</p>
<h3>The Levels of Creosote Build-up</h3>
<p>At the start, creosote will appear flaky or dusty. This is the first degree of creosote build-up. It is attached to the walls loosely so a good <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/services/sweeping/" target="_blank">chimney sweeping</a> will be able to do the trick in removing that unwanted residue. But just because it can be easily removed, doesn’t mean it’s harmless. In fact, because it is very loose and also flammable, there is a good chance that dislodged creosote particles could catch a spark and start a chimney fire all the same. So please do make it a habit to have professionals sweep your chimney to ensure that the cleaning is done properly.</p>
<p>The next level of build-up will have a crunchy and tar-like consistency. This is more difficult to remove as it will require more heavy-duty brushes or even a scraper. If nothing is done at this point, then it will progress further into the next stage.</p>
<p>The third stage of creosote build-up is glazed and gummy or hard. It’s almost like candle wax because it drips down your chimney when exposed to certain temperatures. Then it dries out and becomes hard and glossy again and it could potentially mask some structural damages.</p>
<p>Don’t wait for a chimney fire to break out. Please do not hesitate to give us a call and <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/contact-us/" target="_blank">make an appointment with us </a>at Ashbusters. We always want to put safety first and prevent any untoward incident in your home by making sure your chimney is creosote free.</p>
