<p>Having a chimney in your home is more than just having cozy warm nights with a rustic ambiance. It also entails a lot of responsibility and keen observational skills on your end, especially if you want to ensure your chimney’s functionality as well as your family’s safety.</p>
<p>More often than not, our team at <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/" target="_blank">Ashbusters Chimney Service</a> get approached by homeowners presenting concerns or asking certain things and issues about their chimneys. One of the most asked questions is regarding their chimney draft.</p>
<p><strong><em>So, here’s a short reference that has everything you would need to know about chimney drafts:</em></strong></p>
<h3>What is a chimney draft?</h3>
<p>The chimney draft, or simply called the draft, is the pulling action in your chimney caused by the negative pressure mechanism that’s at play inside each and every one of your chimneys. You see, your chimney produces hot air. When the heat generated inside the chimney reaches a certain level, it starts to pull air through the firebox, and thus, the draft.</p>
<h3>How will you be able to identify a draft problem?</h3>
<p>This is relatively easy to spot. All you need to watch out for are the 3 cardinal signs that are indicative of a chimney draft problem. First, you need to observe the air inside your home. If air begins to enter your home from your chimney, then that’s a sign that something is definitely wrong. Second, when you have unusual trying to start a fire or keep it burning, that’s another sign. And lastly, if you notice a smokey smell around your house even without a fire burning, then that’s definitely a warning sign.</p>
<h3>How does it affect us?</h3>
<p>Initially or in minute cases, draft problems don’t really pose that much of a threat to us. But according to the C<a href="http://www.csia.org/" target="_blank">himney Safety Institute of America</a>, in worst case scenarios it may turn your home into a risky living environment by becoming a fire and health hazard. Carbon monoxide poisoning can easily occur due to improper draft.</p>
<h3>What can we do?</h3>
<p>The best and smartest thing to do is to contact a <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/contact-us/" target="_blank">chimney expert</a> to check your chimney as soon as possible. Not only will they be able to point out damages and risks, but they would also help you in setting up preventive measure as to avoid dreadful and horrible scenarios from ever occurring.</p>
<p>Chimney draft problems are more common than you think. For all you know you have one going on in your home at this very moment. So what are you waiting for? Pick up the phone or open your computers and set an appointment as soon as you can.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Important Functions of the Chimney Safety Institute of America</strong></p>
<p>Many homeowners do not have many questions about their chimneys and fireplaces. They assume that they will always work properly and safely. Then, when there is an issue, they are not sure where to turn. Helping people in this situation is just one of the important functions of the Chimney Safety Institute of America.</p>
<p>The primary function of the Chimney Safety Institute of America is to train qualified chimney sweeps and technicians. They provide a variety of training programs that teach these people the ins and outs of chimney maintenance. In the end, they provide the certification that lets consumers know they are dealing with someone who truly knows what they are doing. In fact, it is advisable that homeowners only use chimney technicians who have been trained and certified by The Chimney Safety Institute of America &#8211; as <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/about-us/" target="_blank">all of us are at Ashbusters</a>.</p>
<div id="attachment_3123" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Trust-the-CSIA-Nashville-TN-Ashbusters.jpg" class="highslide" onclick="return hs.expand(this)" ><img class="size-medium wp-image-3123" alt="The Chimney Safety Institute of America not only trains and certifies sweeps, it provides a plethora of information for homeowners. " src="http://www.ashbusters.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Trust-the-CSIA-Nashville-TN-Ashbusters-300x207.jpg" width="300" height="207" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The Chimney Safety Institute of America not only trains and certifies sweeps, it provides a plethora of information for homeowners.</p></div>
<p>Like any industry, there are always new developments in terms of chimney and fireplace maintenance. In order to provide the best service, chimney professionals must stay on top of all new technologies and techniques. The CSIA, in addition to providing initial training and certification, provides courses that help experiences professionals stay at the head of their field. They can take these classes in person or online, making it easy for any technician to be the best they can be.</p>
<p>Sometimes, a homeowner just has a simply question about their chimney or fireplace. The problem with searching the Internet for information is that it is hard to tell which resources are truly reliable. The <a href="http://www.csia.org/" target="_blank">CSIA&#8217;s website</a> has a number of resources for homeowners that provide a great deal of reliable information. Homeowners do not need to spend hours searching online for information that may or may not be correct. They can go to one place and find information that they can trust.</p>
<p>In some cases, reading a simple article does not help solve the problem. In that case, it may be necessary to bring in a professional. Homeowners can visit its website to find a certified professional in their area. The simple search tool makes it easy to find someone who was trained by the Chimney Safety Institute of American in close proximity to the home. This eliminates the need to spend time and money on someone who does not really know what they are doing and may actually cause more damage.</p>
<p>What many people do not realize is that it also provides these services for dryer vent issues. In addition to training chimney sweeps, its trains and certifies professionals who deal with dryer vents. A homeowner who is having trouble with their dryer can find useful information on the website to help solve the problem.</p>
<p>Many people do not give much though to their chimneys and dryer vents until they have a problem. When they do, though, they often turn to The Chimney Safety Institute of America for assistance. This organization provides valuable resources for homeowners. Most importantly, however, they train professionals who are able to handle the most complicated of issues.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Cleaning Your Industrial Chimneys</b></p>
<p>Industrial chimneys, often called smokestacks, provided the impetus for modern chimney sweeping. It was during the Industrial Revolution that smokestacks appeared and smaller home chimneys began to spread. Small boys were sent up them to clean out the soot and creosote, and constant exposure to toxic materials caused cancers, serious injuries, and deaths.</p>
<div id="attachment_2921" style="width: 228px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Chimney_sweep_modern-w800-h600.jpg" class="highslide" onclick="return hs.expand(this)" ><img class="size-medium wp-image-2921" alt="Modern Chimney Inspection - Nashville TN - Ashbusters" src="http://www.ashbusters.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Chimney_sweep_modern-w800-h600-218x300.jpg" width="218" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Modern Chimney Inspection &#8211; Nashville TN &#8211; Ashbusters</p></div>
<p>Slowly – and thankfully – laws and codes were written to protect these vulnerable children. Comparatively quickly, the reason for those laws and codes changed from protection of little sweeps to the safeguarding of those beneath the chimney. The modern chimney sweep industry exists to facilitate the inspections necessary for confirmation that the chimney may be safely used.</p>
<p><b>Safety First</b></p>
<p>Since there are typically many more people to protect under an “industrial chimney” than one above a single-family home, the first needs much more attention. Smokestacks get far more use, and “scrubbers” and “screens” that protect the environment do it by allowing fewer by-products of combustion out of the chimney. The potential for an explosive chimney fire is definitely present, and the safety of the workplace should be paramount.</p>
<p>In the past, there was at least some excuse for not cleaning smokestacks frequently enough, since it required taking them out of use. That is no longer the case because chimney sweeps with CSIA <a href="http://www.csia.org/" target="_blank">certification</a> can inspect your smokestack ‘remotely’ while it is “on line”. Fittingly called “hot camera inspections”, they allow properly trained chimney sweeps to conduct an informative check of the flue while it is in use.</p>
<p><b>Online Services</b></p>
<p>Combined with other technologies developed to facilitate less disruptive inspection of industrial chimneys, on-line assessments of smokestack conditions leave no excuse for compromising workplace safety. Your employees are counting on you for that, and your local governments are insisting on it. With the ease of having your industrial chimney inspected without a disruption to workflow, a certified chimney sweep can assist you making sure you are in compliance.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ashes do a great job of hiding and insulating hot coals and are often far from the cool gray powdery nothing they appear to be. In fact, in one four-year period, improper ash handling was implicated <i>annually</i> in nearly 10,000 house fires. Proper fireplace tools, fire gloves, and metal pails with lids are small investments in comparison to the homes they protect.</p>
<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2847" title="Burning Wood &amp; Ash - Nashville TN - Ashbusters Chimney" alt="Burning Wood &amp; Ash - Nashville TN - Ashbusters Chimney" src="http://www.ashbusters.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/ashbusters-fireplace-with-burning-wood-and-ash-300x193.jpg" width="300" height="193" />
<p><a href="http://www.csia.org/homeowner-resources/to_remove_or_not_to_remove_ash.aspx" target="_blank">According to the CSIA</a>, an inch of ash beneath the grate at the back of the fireplace is actually good for maintaining a fire. That is again because of those hot coals it contains sending heat back up to the wood. Ash should not rise to the grate, however, and the reasoning for leaving it there carries an implicit warning about the fire-starters within.</p>
<p><b>Equip Yourself for the Job</b></p>
<p>Fireplace tongs help to safely find larger coals and move them without placing your hand under the fire. A fireplace poker is useful for separating them and spreading them out to cool faster. A shovel is essential for safely moving ash and tiny still-hot bits of coal to an equally critical metal pail with a top.</p>
<p>Breaking large coals up into smaller ones causes them to rapidly burn. That is because you are exposing more coal surfaces to the fire, causing faster reactions. This should always be done carefully, though, by wearing fire gloves and breaking the coal against the firebrick at the back.</p>
<p><b>A Squeeze of Lime</b></p>
<p>All fireplace ash eventually needs to be removed. It is highly alkaline, so think before adding it to a compost pile or yard. Any gardening benefits ash may offer start with its safe handling inside the home and its ‘proper’ disposal outdoors. <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/about-us/">To chimney sweeps</a>, “proper disposal” means no possibility of an unintended fire anywhere, and we are pretty sure the gardening professionals agree.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes it is amazing how we scrutinize the littlest of things and then treat something such as a chimney cleaning so casual. Many homeowners do not realize that not just anyone should be entering their home to clean their chimney. In fact, homeowners should take special precaution to ensure that <a href="http://www.ncsg.org/NCSG-Member/Ashbusters-Chimney-Service-Inc" target="_blank">only NCSG member sweeps</a> are doing the cleaning.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2274" title="National Chimney Sweep Guild" alt="National Chimney Sweep Guild" src="http://www.ashbusters.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/ashbusters-ncsg-logo.png" width="210" height="90" /></p>
<p>The National Chimney Sweep Guild, or NCSG, in an organization started over three decades ago with less than two dozen members. Today, it is the standard for all chimney sweeps. It is a true educational source for homeowners and chimney sweeps alike. In fact, the organization conducts various seminars and classes specifically to prepare sweeps for the membership exam.</p>
<p>In addition to the NCSG, homeowners should also look for sweeps that are certified from the Chimney Safety Institute of America, or CSIA. This organization provides a code of ethics by which all chimney sweeps must abide. This code provides the thousands of homeowners employing their services every year significant peace of mind.</p>
<p>These two programs together have literally created the industry standard for chimney sweeps. When inquiring with different companies, tell the agent specifically that you are requesting member chimney sweeps and that they have their credentials readily available for your inspection. This will also serve to let the company know you are aware of the membership process as well as the code of ethics sweeps are expected to follow.</p>
<p>When looking for certified chimney sweeps, homeowners can use both the CSIA website (www.csia.org) and the NCSG website (www.ncsg.org) to find certified and member companies. If there was ever a time to avoid taking the short cut and using personal ad sites to find a service provider, this is it! You family&#8217;s safety and that of your home are far too important to trust to some random individual.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Browsing the telephone book or doing an online search reveals the large number of chimney sweeps in a given area. When considering which individual to contact, homeowners should take several things into consideration. Verifying that the chimney sweep has a <a title="Ashbusters CSIA Certification" href="http://www.csia.org/CSIA-Certified/Mark-Stoner" target="_blank">Chimney Safety Institute of America (CSIA) certification</a> is one of them.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2216" title="Ashbusters Chimney Service - CSIA Certification" alt="Ashbusters Chimney Service - CSIA Certification" src="http://www.ashbusters.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/ashbusters-csia-logo.jpg" width="163" height="160" /></p>
<p>In North America, more than <a href="http://www.csia.org/Certification/" target="_blank">1,300 chimney sweeps have earned the CSIA certification</a>. This credential is considered a measurement of knowledge regarding chimney and venting system evaluation and maintenance. An increasing number of local, state, and federal agencies, insurance underwriters, and industry organizations are acknowledging the CSIA certification as an industry standard. The importance of this designation cannot be understated.</p>
<p>CSIA regularly reevaluates the relevance of this credential and increases credentialing standards to ensure that certified chimney sweeps are the best in the business. Its mission is to help eliminate residential chimney fires, intrusion of carbon monoxide, and other chimney hazards that cause loss of property and lives. Homebuilders, home inspectors, oil and gas heat providers, and real estate agents feel comfortable recommending a CSIA certified chimney sweep to homeowners requiring chimney inspection and maintenance.</p>
<p>The CSIA credential has been in existence for more than three decades. Homeowners use it as a measurement for the technical expertise of their chimney sweeps. Local, regional, and national publications and media including <em>Good Morning America</em>,<em> 20/20</em>, <em>Consumer Reports</em>, and <em>The New York Times </em>have highlighted the knowledge of CSIA certified chimney sweeps, giving the credential national recognition.</p>
<p>When looking for someone to service the chimney, do not settle for anyone who is not CSIA certified. This credential is a testament to the quality of service provided, whether reviewing the status of the chimney or cleaning it.
