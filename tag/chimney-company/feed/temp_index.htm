				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chimney cleanliness is very important to the health, warmth, and safety of your home. A <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/services/inspections/" target="_blank">quality chimney inspection</a> can save you money and alert you to any possible problems your chimney may have that could result in a dangerous situation. The Chimney Safety Institute of America recommends using a CSIA Certified Chimney Sweep who will adhere to the three levels of inspection as put into code by the National Fire Protection Association. A Level Three inspection is the absolute best inspection as it covers all areas of chimney use and any possible changes that have or will be made to your chimney system. A solid chimney inspection will provide you with the peace of mind necessary to enjoy your chimney.</p>
<p>Chimney inspections are very important. Even if you don&#8217;t use your chimney that often a proper chimney inspection is crucial to anyone who owns a property with a chimney in order to keep your house and family safe. Chimney inspections ensure the proper care and maintenance of the chimney unit and can serve as a warning if there are any significant problems in your chimney of which you aren&#8217;t currently aware. It&#8217;s easy to locate a CSIA Certified Chimney Sweep in your area. Just go to <a href="http://www.csia.org/" target="_blank">www.csia.org</a> and click on the “Homeowner Resources” tab at the top of the page. A drop down menu will appear. Choose the last tab, “Locate a CSIA Certified Professional” and click on it. You will see a page that allows you to place as much information as you choose and once complete, click the “Search” button on the page and a list of certified technicians will appear. These chimney professional are considered some of the best in your area. The importance of a good chimney inspection must be taken seriously to make sure your chimney is working safely and soundly so hire the best you can find for the job.</p>
<p>A chimney inspection will cause no damage to your chimney unit. Some tools may be used to obtain access and remove panels and coverings. However, during a proper chimney inspection your home and chimney unit will not sustain any scratching or structural damage to the finish or building. For proper safety you should order a chimney inspection at least once per year.</p>
