				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The reasons your fire won’t light depend first of all on whether it is a gas fed fire or a wood fire. If it uses natural gas as its fuel, check to be sure that the turn key or valve handle are in the open position, and that the fireplace is receiving gas. If you are lighting a wood fire, chances are you need to break it down and rebuild it.</p>
<p>There are two equally effective ways to <a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_2074100_build-wood-fire-fireplace.html" target="_blank">build a wood fire</a>: the traditional bottom up teepee or a top-down approach. The steps involved are the same for both, but the order in which the layers are put down is reversed. Contrary to popular belief, you don’t have to work from small kindling to large logs to easily light and maintain a good fire.</p>
<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2785" title="Wood Fire - Nashville TN - Ashbusters Chimney Service" alt="Wood Fire - Nashville TN - Ashbusters Chimney Service" src="http://www.ashbusters.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/ashbusters-why-your-fire-wont-light-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" />
<p>The layers are simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>crumpled newspaper</li>
<li>kindling</li>
<li>sticks</li>
<li>mid-sized pieces of wood</li>
<li>logs</li>
</ul>
<p>Whether placed logs first or built on top of newspaper and kindling, if it is built so that air can move around it, the fire will catch and burn. If the kindling is on top, the fire is that much easier to light.</p>
<p>Another bonus of building a top-down fire is that the heavier logs which usually end up crashing through the tent frame are already on the bottom. This is also a more stable fire, with heavier pieces supporting lighter ones more firmly positioned. Finally, there’s the enjoyment of defying expectations and proving your friends wrong when your fire lights just as easily as a traditional one.</p>
<p>The purpose of the newspaper is to quickly catch and spread to the kindling, extremely small sticks and slivers of wood. The kindling is the accelerant of the fire itself, burning easily and spreading fire to sticks and mid-sized pieces of wood. These in turn relay heat to the logs, eventually setting them on fire to burn long and hot.</p>
<p>Remember, having <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/services/inspections/">yearly chimney inspections</a> will identify potential problems with your fireplace and chimney system. Calling us to perform an inspection will help keep you safe, and help you to better enjoy your home.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To safely ignite <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/catalog/fireplaces-and-stoves/contemporary-gas-fireplaces/">your gas fireplace</a>, follow this series of easy to remember steps.</p>
<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2526" alt="Safely igniting your gas fireplace" src="http://www.ashbusters.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/ashbusters-safely-igniting-gas-fireplace-300x207.png" width="300" height="207" />
<ul>
<li>Check to be sure the damper is open to your venting. Gas logs give off a great deal of carbon monoxide, so adequate venting is essential. The damper can be partially closed later on to prevent excessive heat loss but, obviously, smoke needs to be drawn up the chimney and out of the house.</li>
<li>Start the flow of gas to your fireplace appliance. There is usually a gas supply valve inside the glass doors of the fireplace. This connects the fireplace to the gas line. Turn the valve on or to its open position to admit gas to the fireplace pipe.</li>
<li>Check to be sure the pilot light is lit. If it is not, this needs to be corrected first. Generally, there is a knob that has to be turned counter-clockwise to the pilot position. Release the knob. There is also usually a button that you need to press to send gas to the pilot. Press the button for a full minute, or until an igniter sparks a flame. The igniter may have to be clicked several times.</li>
<li>Once the pilot has been lit, it will ignite gas sent to the logs. After inserting the key into the keyhole at the front of the fireplace, turn it clockwise. You should be able to hear gas flowing to the fireplace. With either a match or a grill lighter, light the fire. The fireplace may also be equipped with a red ignition button.</li>
<li>The safest practice is to turn out the pilot light and stop the flow of gas to the fireplace altogether when it is not in use. This entails shutting the gas supply valve as well, completely stopping the passage of gas into the fireplace pipe.</li>
</ul>
