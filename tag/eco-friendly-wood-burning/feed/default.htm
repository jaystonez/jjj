				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;" align="center"><b>Eco-Friendly Practices for Chimney Owners</b></p>
<p> One of the biggest issues we face in today’s world is the fragile state of our environment. With global temperatures rising and ice caps melting it becomes more and more important to be aware of the environmental impact our decisions have on the world around us. Even though the planet as a whole is warming it doesn&#8217;t mean that the winter will bring any less of a chill and nothing warms us up on a cold winter night better than a roaring fire in a wood-burning fireplace. As wonderful and cozy as it is to sit around a crackling fire with a cup of your favorite warm beverage it certainly doesn&#8217;t help our air quality to be sending all that wood smoke up into the atmosphere.</p>
<div id="attachment_3016" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Eco-Friendly-Tips-for-Chimney-Owners-Nashville-TN-Ashbusters.jpg" class="highslide" onclick="return hs.expand(this)" ><img class="size-medium wp-image-3016" alt="There are several ways you can be eco-friendly when building a fire." src="http://www.ashbusters.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Eco-Friendly-Tips-for-Chimney-Owners-Nashville-TN-Ashbusters-300x193.jpg" width="300" height="193" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">There are several ways you can be eco-friendly when building a fire.</p></div>
<p>Luckily there are many steps you can take to cut down on your wood smoke emissions and reduce your fireplace’s impact on the world around you. And if green isn&#8217;t your thing don’t worry! There are plenty of economic and safety benefits as well! One of the biggest steps you can take is to have a new chimney insert installed by a qualified professional. Chimney inserts install directly into your fireplace and chimney and work like a wood-stove. This greatly increases the efficiency of your fireplace. Most inserts made after 1992 are certified by the EPA and will help keep the heat where it’s supposed to be. This means a hotter fire, a warmer home, and a cleaner environment. A lot of states have even instituted tax breaks and other incentives for people who use EPA-certified chimney products to heat their home.</p>
<p>Another big way to increase the efficiency of your fireplace is as simple as how your build your fire. It is important to always use dry, seasoned wood. This wood burns cleaner and hotter than green or wet wood. Burning green wood can coat your chimney in a flammable film that can result in chimney fires and could ultimately lead to the loss of your home. Another common mistake that people make when starting a fire is to use a large grate and spread the logs out. The hotter your fire the less byproduct you produce and the more efficient your fireplace is. When you spread logs out over a large grate you will produce more smoke and less heat. The less heat your fire is producing the more wood you have to burn and the more wood you burn the more money comes out of your pocket.</p>
<p>Finally, one of the biggest and most dangerous mistakes people make that can hurt the environment or even burn down your house is “home remedy chimney sweeping”. There are tons of old wives’ tales out there about burning various household items to sweep your own chimney. Unfortunately most of these do much more harm than good. Some will coat your chimney in a flammable muck, some will produce toxic gases, and some will simply cause your chimney to catch fire. It is very important to <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/services/inspections/" target="_blank">ALWAYS use a professional</a>, certified chimney sweep to make sure your chimney is clean, eco-friendly, and most importantly safe for you and your family to enjoy. So whether you are trying to go green or just trying to save some money there is no excuse not to practice eco-friendly techniques when it comes to enjoying your wood-burning fireplaces this winter.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A huge trend in America today is “going green,” or preserving the state of the environment.  Some ways that this has been done are eliminating paper towels in public restrooms (replacing them instead with air hand dryers), removing place mats in restaurants and the development of electric cars to reduce fuel pollution.  Individuals often wonder what they can do themselves to help maintain the environment too.  Such options include using products made from recycled materials.  Another major way to help the environment is the way you heat your home.  Making good use of the fireplace is both cost effective and more or less environmentally neutral.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2223" title="Eco-friendliness of wood burning" alt="Eco-friendliness of wood burning" src="http://www.ashbusters.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/ashbusters-wood-burning-fire-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></p>
<p><strong>Environmental Impact</strong></p>
<p><em>Wait…I thought burning wood was bad!  </em>This is somewhat misguided.  If done <a href="http://www.highschimney.com/articles/reduce-chimney-fireplace-pollution/">properly</a>, wood burning is a good option.  We say that wood is environmentally “neutral” because during a tree’s lifetime, it will take in a certain amount of carbon dioxide from the environment.  This same tree will then release the CO2 it took in back into the environment regardless of whether the wood is burned or it decays naturally.  The <strong>tree won’t add any more carbon dioxide than it took</strong> to begin with.</p>
<p><strong>Low Cost</strong></p>
<p>Some people become concerned around winter time because they know that the heating bill will skyrocket.  While you may avoid this by telling your family member s to simply “Put on a sweater,” another great option is using the fireplace.  Here’s how other energy prices stack up against wood costs: electricity is seven times more costly, propane is five times more expensive and natural gas is three times the cost and of wood.  Using wood smartly can result in dramatic savings throughout the course of the season.</p>
<p><strong>Renewability </strong></p>
<p>The world as a whole is expected to run out of fossil fuels within 50 years time.  We keep drilling and drilling, but the fact remains that the earth only has so much crude oil to give.  Prices already reach ridiculous levels, and it will continue.  Wood, however, has the potential to be available indefinitely.  While wood harvesters continuously cut trees down for firewood and other uses, they tend to follow the rule of thumb of planting more trees than they take.  Over time, these trees mature for use and the cycle continues.</p>
<p><strong>Efficiency</strong></p>
<p>Most wood that is good for fireplace use releases relatively little smoke (i.e. oaks, hickories and poplars).  At the same time, the smoke that does come from wood burning rarely makes its way out your chimney and into the atmosphere.  Today’s <a href="http://www.highschimney.com/woodstoves/">stove and fireplace units</a> allow 90% less smoke into the air, as per EPA regulations, and many units actually burn not only the wood but also the smoke and gas released.   It’s safer <em>and </em>burns longer!  The heat produced by modern units also circulates around the room, constantly warming the space.</p>
<p><strong>Reduces Waste</strong></p>
<p>How many of us get rid of old wood (i.e. building materials or landscaping scraps), putting it on the side of the road for the trash collector?  This wood is being thrown into a landfill with all of the other garbage.  What a waste!  Instead, take your materials and cut them up for the fire (though be sure not to use painted or chemically-treated wood).  Every year in the U.S. we throw away enough wood to heat 5 million homes over a 200 year period!</p>
<p>See?  Burning wood is not only good, but also cost effective and efficient.  Next time you find yourself wondering if starting a fire in the fireplace is a good idea, remember that it not only worked for our predecessors (i.e. in the days of Columbus), but wood will also be around longer than other energy sources.  It just makes sense!</p>
