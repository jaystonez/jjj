				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One big thing for homeowners to think about is which type of fireplace do they want. Now this decision can come as they are shopping for a new home, but it can also come when they are thinking about a home remodeling project. It is important to remember that adding a fireplace does not necessarily mean having to have major structural changes to your home. Of course, structural changes are a possibility. It all depends on the choices you make.</p>
<p>One very popular form of fireplace installation is a direct vent gas fireplace. They provide a very efficient way of heating the home, and help homeowners avoid the mess of a traditional wood fireplace. These are powered by either propane or natural gas. You can also get ventless fireplaces that use natural gas or propane, but we do not recommend them. The chance of Carbon Monoxide poisoning is too great.</p>
<p>Electric fireplaces and Pellet stoves are additional types of fireplace appliances. Electric fireplaces are useful for some people, but they have to keep in mind that this type of fireplace can cost you more than a gas alternative. Plus, if you ever experience a power outage, the fireplace is not going to work. Pellet stoves can be a useful alternative to having an insert. Plus, they are probably cheaper in regards to home modifications.</p>
<p>Finally, there is always the good old wood stove and chimney choice. While you may not want to spend the money to add one to an existing home, most new home constructions give you the choice of what you want to do. Many will even let you choose between gas and wood burning. Whatever type of fireplace or stove you are thinking about, make sure you research the various safety precautions that go along with that choice. You want to make sure you are prepared to do whatever is safest for you and your family.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/catalog/fireplaces-and-stoves/pellet-stoves-and-inserts/">Pellet Stoves</a> are enclosed heating devices that require compressed wood or wood pellets to make a heat source for residential, industrial and other purposes. By gradually putting pellets into a burn-pot space from a storage container, they constantly create a flame that needs little or no alterations. They are similar to wood burning stoves and fireplaces but are different in that they are electronically sophisticated machines that give a low cost heating choice for homeowners. They are an environmentally friendly type of home appliance and can help families stay warm while saving money in the short and long term.</p>
<p>Pellet Stoves are managed by electricity. The pellets are fed into a hopper that is situated either at the bottom or at the top of the unit. The auger which is a long screw motorized apparatus retrieves the pellets from the hopper inside the burn pot. Pellets are compressed inside the combustion chamber and then ignited while the burn pot creates an avenue for the fusion of air and fuel that both have to be available for the process of burning. The ash pot captures the burnt pellets while the pellet stove releases hot air through the process known as convection. In this process, the convection blower attracts cool air inside the area, passing it to the flame. The air then moves across to the heat exchanger heating up. The hot air is pushed into the exhaust blower to be released into the environment. Finally, a thermostat manages the device to control the number of pellets and regulates heat combustion.</p>
<p>Pellet Stoves are the simplest operational wood burning stoves and have several benefits. The burning process of compressed pellets is very efficient and made up of minimal moisture which releases little or no harmful gasses to the surroundings. Moreover, the fuel cost is very cheap. It does not produce smoke and you don&#8217;t have to deal with dryness or the nasty smell other types of stoves leave in the room. Their outer design is secure for most home set up and safe for families with children.</p>
