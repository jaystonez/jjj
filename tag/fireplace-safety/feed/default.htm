				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are a lot of safety tips that you can follow in order to operate your fireplace in a safe way. The fireplace is a common source of danger for many homes. One good tip to avoid this is to keep the screen doors of your fireplace closed. This will not only help you keep the ashes in the fireplace, but also help you get rid of sparks and other damage to the home. This is true especially, if your fireplace is a little close to any appliances. You can further consult the professionals for more information regarding fireplace safety, but one good thing to remember is to use the available wood present in your community for the fireplace.</p>
<p>You use local wood because it is the most suitable for your fireplace. More often than not, fireplaces are built with the components that are already present in the community. You will not likely import the bricks or cement that you will be using for your chimney. It is just right to say that there will be no better wood for your fireplace than local wood. It will blend well with the components of the materials that you use for the other parts of your heat source. It is also good to take note that using local wood will help lessen the soot that piles up in the chimney. Soot is a dangerous element. It will hasten the deterioration that may take place in your chimney. This is the perfect wood for your fireplace because you will be able to save a lot of money, too. Plus, its price is cheaper than the wood sold in a supermarket. That wood is typically trucked in. It may even be free if you have plenty of trees in your backyard. It will take you just a little extra effort to find firewood from your local area, and you will be much happier with the result.</p>
