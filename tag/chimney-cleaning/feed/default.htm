				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Before you light your first fire of the season,it is recommended by national fire safety organizations like The Chimney Safety Institute of America (CSIA) and The National Fire Prevention Association (NFPA) that you should schedule your annual chimney sweeping and inspection. Our CSIA-certified chimney technicians at Ashbusters agree. In Middle Tennessee, we are fortunate to have warm early fall temperatures; however, we never know when a cold snap may surprise us. By preparing your fireplace and chimney for winter before the fall season gets underway, you will be a step ahead and will not have to wait for weeks for a chimney sweep and inspection appointment. Getting your fireplace and chimney ready to use for the cold months of the year is smart chimney maintenance, and we would like to answer some of your questions about the winter preparation of a chimney.</p>
<p><a href="http://ashbusters.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/yearly-chimney-maintenance-nashville-tn-ashbusters.jpg" class="highslide" onclick="return hs.expand(this)" ><img class="size-medium wp-image-3566 alignright" src="file:///N:/Users/PZ/Documents/My Web Sites/Brandoo WordPress (MS SQL or Azure SQL)/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/yearly-chimney-maintenance-nashville-tn-ashbusters-216x325.jpg" alt="Yearly Chimney Maintenance - Nashville TN - Ashbusters" width="216" height="325" /></a></p>
<h3>Why Is It So Important to Get My Chimney Cleaned and Inspected Before Fall?</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.cleveland.com/insideout/index.ssf/2009/10/chimney_fireplace_should_be_ch.html" target="_blank">According to the article</a>, “Chimney, Fireplace Should Be Checked Before Winter Sets In,” from the <em>Cleveland Plain Dealer</em>, statistics back up the importance of having your annual chimney cleaning and inspecting done before you begin using your fireplace for the winter. 24,500 residential fires originating from the chimney and fireplace occurred in the year 2005, as cited by the US Consumer Product Safety Commission. These fires claimed the lives of 20 people and damaged about $126 million worth of property. A professional chimney sweeping will be sure your chimney is free from fire hazards.</p>
<h3>What Is the Greatest Fire Hazard of a Dirty Chimney?</h3>
<p>The main culprit behind chimney fires is creosote building up on your chimney walls. Highly flammable deposits, creosote is the natural result of the condensation that occurs when the by-products of combustion like smoke, gases, and vapors exit the cooler upper chimney walls. Creosote eventually turns into a baked-on glaze inside your chimney, which, if the temperatures reach a high enough point, will ignite the chimney liner and the walls. Ashbusters has years of experience is cleaning the glazed creosote from chimneys and making the chimneys safe to use throughout the winter months.</p>
<h3>What Else Does Ashbusters Do to Prepare My Chimney for Winter?</h3>
<p>When we perform our chimney sweeping and inspection, we also:</p>
<ul>
<li>examine the exterior of your chimney on the roof to check the chimney cap, the flashing, and the masonry work to be sure there are no signs of damaging water penetration</li>
<li>ensure your damper opens and closes properly</li>
<li>make sure there is a clearance of at least 18 inches from your fireplace to anything that could be combustible, such as furniture and curtains</li>
<li>inspect the chimney liner for cracks and other damage</li>
<li>protect your safety by being sure there is some sort of screen in front of your fireplace</li>
<li>advise you on proper ash removal.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have not scheduled your annual chimney sweeping and inspection yet, <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/contact-us/">contact us</a> today. We will arrange an appointment for our CSIA-certified technicians to prepare your chimney for winter.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The threat of carbon monoxide poisoning can happen in your home. A scary thought? Neglecting regular chimney maintenance can result in carbon monoxide leaking into your home without you even realize it. Odorless, tasteless, and invisible, this toxic gas can even become trapped within your house. If you do not have a carbon monoxide alarm installed to alert you, you and your family could fall prey to illness or death from continuously inhaling large amounts of this gas. To be even safer from the dangers of carbon monoxide poisoning, an annual chimney sweeping and inspection from a Chimney Safety Institute of America (CSIA)-certified company like Ashbusters can stop this gas from becoming a problem. We would like to inform you about these dangers so that you can protect yourself and your family.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/carbon-monoxide-dangers-nashville-tn-ashbusters.jpg" class="highslide" onclick="return hs.expand(this)"  title="Carbon Monoxide - Nashville TN - Ashbusters"><img class="alignright wp-image-3478 size-medium" title="Carbon Monoxide - Nashville TN - Ashbusters" src="http://www.ashbusters.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/carbon-monoxide-dangers-nashville-tn-ashbusters-297x350.jpg" alt="Carbon Monoxide - Nashville TN - Ashbusters" width="297" height="350" /></a></p>
<h3>How Does Carbon Monoxide Affect My Body?</h3>
<p>When you breathe in carbon monoxide, the poisonous gas enters your bloodstream. What your blood naturally does with this gas is the true danger. Hemoglobin, a protein in your blood, chooses to pick up and carry the carbon monoxide and to ignore oxygen. Of course, we need oxygen flowing through our bloodstreams to keep our cells from suffocating. The amount of damage caused depends on how long and how intensely you are exposed to inhaling carbon monoxide.</p>
<h3>How Common Are Deaths and Illnesses Due to Carbon Monoxide Poisoning?</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.csia.org/homeowner-resources/Avoiding_Carbon_Monoxide_Hazards.aspx" target="_blank">According to the CSIA</a>, at least 200 people in the U.S. are killed every year from carbon monoxide poisoning caused by venting problems in their heating systems. Approximately 10,000 cases of sickness related to carbon monoxide are recorded each year as well.</p>
<h3>What are the Side-Effects and Symptoms of Carbon Monoxide Poisoning?</h3>
<p>Side-effects of low-level exposure can include permanent brain and other organ damage. Unfortunately, the symptoms of low-level poisoning are much like those of the common cold: headache, dizziness, fatigue, and nausea. This causes many misdiagnoses of carbon monoxide poisoning, which prolongs the exposure. If these symptoms do not go away, be persistent with your doctor and ask for a blood test to check for levels of this toxic gas. The sooner high levels are found, the sooner life-saving treatment can begin.</p>
<h3>How Does This Gas Enter My House?</h3>
<p>Poor ventilation is the primary cause of carbon monoxide coming into your home; however, the factors behind the venting problems include a damaged or missing chimney flue liner, large deposits of creosote, debris clogging the passageway, and nesting from birds or other animals blocking the flue.</p>
<h3>How Can I Stop Carbon Monoxide from Entering My Home?</h3>
<p>All of the factors behind chimney ventilation problems can be corrected with an annual chimney sweeping and inspection from Ashbusters. With cases of carbon monoxide-related health issues on the rise, our CSIA-certified chimney sweeps will clean out any blockages, check flue liners for damaging cracks, and replace a deteriorated chimney liner to protect you from the dangers of carbon monoxide poisoning.</p>
<p>If you have not scheduled your annual chimney sweeping and inspection this year, contact Ashbusters today. Our staff will arrange a chimney sweep visit to your home as soon as possible.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the best things you can do to improve your home’s fire safety is stop walking away from the stove while you are cooking. Accounting for roughly <a href="http://www.nfpa.org/categoryList.asp?categoryID=282&amp;URL=Safety%20Information/For%20consumers/Causes/Cooking" target="_blank">44 percent of all home fires</a>, the way you cook can be seriously damaging to your family’s well-being! Not only are you what you eat, but how you cook can determine whether your family stays safe.</p>
<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2832" title="Cooking Fire - Nashville TN - Ashbusters Chimney Service" alt="Cooking Fire - Nashville TN - Ashbusters Chimney Service" src="http://www.ashbusters.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/ashbusters-cooking-fire-199x300.jpg" width="199" height="300" />
<p>Another good measure to take is to have your clothes dryer venting professionally cleaned from time to time. How often this needs to be done varies with use and other factors, but dryer vents are notorious culprits in house fires. Highly flammable lint can also gather in air ducts throughout the house, so they should be inspected at the same time.</p>
<p><b>Keep an Eye on Fire </b></p>
<p>Your fireplace system is another obvious thing to attend to regularly; perhaps the most obvious of all. The only place besides the stove where we purposely start indoor fires, the fireplace deserves to be maintained in tip-top condition. The affordable services of CSIA certified chimney sweeps can prevent a lot of avoidable expense and heartache.</p>
<p>Outdoor fireplaces, grills, and fire pits start their share of house fires, either through inattention to their condition or carelessness in their use. Grills and fire pits should never be placed close to the house or flammables, and they need a steady surface beneath them. They also have to be watched, just like stoves, since a flying spark outdoors can be just as much of a problem.</p>
<p><b>Nothing Tasty About Smoked Houses</b></p>
<p>From simple things that you can do better yourself to obviously complicated systems that have to be <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/services/">examined by professionals</a>, the effort is worth it. The only thing you want going up in smoke is your salmon under the hood of a clean grill in good condition. So kill the fire where it is, until you can give it some attention and keep it where it belongs.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Because they are <a href="http://www.csia.org/Certification/why_the_ccs_credential_is_the_industry_standard.aspx" target="_blank">trained professionals</a> with years of experience, chimney sweeps can spot potential problems that might be missed by the untrained eye. This is especially likely in the dark shaft of the chimney where creosote, like toxic tar, build up on the bricks. <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/services/sweeping/">Proper chimney cleaning</a> requires a lot of special equipment, which the professionals bring along as a matter of course and may be made part of the chimney repair.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2529" title="Chimney maintenance should not be DIY" alt="Chimney maintenance should not be DIY" src="http://www.ashbusters.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/ashbusters-chimney-cleaning-is-not-diy-300x201.png" width="300" height="201" />Chimney repair is especially tricky for Do-It-Yourselfers. A chimney venting problem is often the reason for a chimney repair. The mechanical control of the vent flap stops operating due to corrosion, and there is no way to vent smoke through the flue and out of the room. Replacing this part usually means removing part of the masonry so that it is accessible. Proper installment of new masonry after the part has been replaced is a job best left to professionals.</p>
<p>Problems involving the mortar in the chimney may require a repair. Mortar gradually shrinks, which results in gaps between the chimney cap and the flue. These have to be sealed with mortar caulk and kept damp for several days so that the mortar caulk can cure properly.</p>
<p>Professional chimney repair ensures that the job is properly done. This prevents more costly replacements and repairs down the line when a DIY corrective measure actually exacerbates the problem and causes other defects to occur. It also means that homeowners do not have to move around on their roofs, falls from which can be deadly. Furthermore, cracks and holes in chimney flues and masonry create safety hazards, best assessed by professionals.</p>
<p>Obviously, some chimney repair, such as extending the height of the chimney and relining chimney flues, simply exceeds the grasp of most amateurs. The consequences of doing them incorrectly are so costly and potentially so dangerous that they are not worth the risk. The best bet for any sort of major chimney repair is to call in a professional.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What, did you just hear a noise that sounded like baby birds coming from your chimney? Chances are those sounds are coming from baby Chimney Swifts waiting for food. Unfortunately, you can do little about it until the birds are done nesting in your chimney. Why? Because Chimney Swifts are protected under the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Migratory_Bird_Treaty_Act_of_1918" target="_blank">Migratory Bird Treaty Act</a>.</p>
<p>If you have called a chimney sweep and they have offered to remove the birds, you should know right now that this is illegal and you should be dealing with a different chimney cleaning company. In fact, the proper response from them would be to advise you to not use the chimney and delay the cleaning until the baby birds have left their nest. At this time, the chimney can be cleaned and precautions can be put in place to ensure this does not happen again.</p>
<p>Once the birds are gone, have your chimney inspected and cleaned as soon as possible. At this time, inquire about a chimney cap being installed on the chimney. In addition to the cap, the chimney should be fitted for a protective screen that will further prevent birds, small animals, and leaves from getting into the flue of the chimney. The cap will also help prevent water and other outside elements from getting into the chimney and causing structural damage to the chimney or the chimney liner.</p>
<p>Swifts like to return to previous nesting spaces, so if the problem is not addressed, you will more than likely have the same problem next year. You should know that not taking these precautions can lead to a very dangerous situation for both you and the birds. If the nest has not been cleaned out, it may have become unstable over the course of time and the birds could fall down inside the chimney while nesting. In addition, parasites may have become embedded in the nest, further endangering the birds.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soot" target="_blank">Chimney soot</a> is fine black or dark brown powder formed due to incomplete combustion of wood or coal in a confined place. Hence it can be correctly referred to as the byproduct of fireplace combustion. Soot is formed in a temperature lower than 284 degrees. When fuel like wood, or charcoal burns, it breaks down and deposits itself as a powdery dust called soot. It is also responsible for giving a fire its yellow or reddish orange color as it radiates colors in the red to yellow spectrum. The other common names for chimney soot are lamp black and carbon black. It forms a common ingredient in the making of shoe polish.</p>
<p>Due to its color and texture, soot tends to darken or stain surfaces. It stains ventilations, walls, ceilings, floors, clothes, and even skin, and to do that, it is not even required in large proportions or concentrations. Since it is not burnt totally, creosote is slightly sticky and tends to cling to surfaces like exhaust pipes and chimney flue. Due to its blocking tendency, numerous problems can arise. Let us take a look at what they are:</p>
<ul>
<li>A clogged or blocked chimney is not able to draw in air smoothly. Hence fires become smoky and consume more and more fuel.</li>
<li>If creosote accumulates in the chimney in a substantial quantity, it may be the cause of chimney fires. This is one reason why chimneys should be regularly inspected and cleaned.</li>
<li>If soot falls back into the house through the chimney, the floors can get dirty and messy. This happens when the byproduct accumulates in the chimney, and due to the back-suction of air, it gets pulled back towards the inside of the house. Soot can stain carpets and floors and cleaning it up can get extremely messy.</li>
<li>Being a carbon byproduct, soot can also become a health hazard. If inhaled in proportional quantities, it can affect the lungs and result in lung diseases and respiratory infections. This happens as soot contains polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in its gaseous form. This is not only harmful, but is also difficult to treat in case one acquires a serious infection or illness from this by product.</li>
</ul>
<p>Chimney soot and creosote is inevitable and will be formed due to the use of a fireplace. So to avoid it, the only choice is to get your chimney cleaned.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wow!  You might be saying since it’s the first week in August. However, you&#8217;ll turn around and the kids will be back in school, Labor Day will be long since past and Thanksgiving will be right around the corner. I know this because it happens to me every year!</p>
<p>Another thing happens to me as well, I forget there are a few things that are “must do’s” before the cold sets in and one of those will insure the very life of my family! So why is it so easy to forget about getting the <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/services/sweeping/">chimney cleaned</a>? I have decided it’s one of those “out of sight out of mind” things but this year it’s different.</p>
<p>My wife and I established a home calendar at the beginning of the year on Google. If you don’t know how to do it its really easy and you can find out more about it <a href="www.google.com/calendar" target="_blank">here</a>. On this calendar you are able to color code so we have a color that highlights family and friend’s birthdays, another one for functions we are attending and then we have a RED color that is for things that have to be done; no questions asked. It is here that at the end of August we have listed; call Ashbusters and get the chimney swept.</p>
<p>We always ask them to <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/services/dryer-vent-cleaning/">clean the dryer vent</a> when they’re out to the house as well so I know that two of the most important things on my list to keep my family safe and healthy will be done every year. But don’t take my word for it, go and do the research yourself so the information will stick. You will be amazed how many fires are caused by these two hazards in your home, not to mention the poisoning effects from smoke that can seep into your home in places you will never see.</p>
<p>The most important thing to remember is not to forget to get this done on an annual basis; and don’t leave it to chance. Set up a reminder now on your home calendar or Smart Phone. You and your family will be glad you did!</p>
