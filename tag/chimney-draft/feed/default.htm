<p>Having a chimney in your home is more than just having cozy warm nights with a rustic ambiance. It also entails a lot of responsibility and keen observational skills on your end, especially if you want to ensure your chimney’s functionality as well as your family’s safety.</p>
<p>More often than not, our team at <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/" target="_blank">Ashbusters Chimney Service</a> get approached by homeowners presenting concerns or asking certain things and issues about their chimneys. One of the most asked questions is regarding their chimney draft.</p>
<p><strong><em>So, here’s a short reference that has everything you would need to know about chimney drafts:</em></strong></p>
<h3>What is a chimney draft?</h3>
<p>The chimney draft, or simply called the draft, is the pulling action in your chimney caused by the negative pressure mechanism that’s at play inside each and every one of your chimneys. You see, your chimney produces hot air. When the heat generated inside the chimney reaches a certain level, it starts to pull air through the firebox, and thus, the draft.</p>
<h3>How will you be able to identify a draft problem?</h3>
<p>This is relatively easy to spot. All you need to watch out for are the 3 cardinal signs that are indicative of a chimney draft problem. First, you need to observe the air inside your home. If air begins to enter your home from your chimney, then that’s a sign that something is definitely wrong. Second, when you have unusual trying to start a fire or keep it burning, that’s another sign. And lastly, if you notice a smokey smell around your house even without a fire burning, then that’s definitely a warning sign.</p>
<h3>How does it affect us?</h3>
<p>Initially or in minute cases, draft problems don’t really pose that much of a threat to us. But according to the C<a href="http://www.csia.org/" target="_blank">himney Safety Institute of America</a>, in worst case scenarios it may turn your home into a risky living environment by becoming a fire and health hazard. Carbon monoxide poisoning can easily occur due to improper draft.</p>
<h3>What can we do?</h3>
<p>The best and smartest thing to do is to contact a <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/contact-us/" target="_blank">chimney expert</a> to check your chimney as soon as possible. Not only will they be able to point out damages and risks, but they would also help you in setting up preventive measure as to avoid dreadful and horrible scenarios from ever occurring.</p>
<p>Chimney draft problems are more common than you think. For all you know you have one going on in your home at this very moment. So what are you waiting for? Pick up the phone or open your computers and set an appointment as soon as you can.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/catalog/chimney-caps/">Chimney caps</a> are the part of the chimney sitting atop the bit of flue that can be seen above the chimney top. A chimney cap does for the flue what a crown does for the chase, but also keeps debris and critters out of the chimney. Chimney caps, too, need to be sloped to direct water away from the flue; they, too, need to be properly designed and installed.</p>
<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2840" title="Chimney with Cap - Nashville TN - Ashbusters Chimney" alt="Chimney with Cap - Nashville TN - Ashbusters Chimney" src="http://www.ashbusters.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/ashbusters-chimney-with-cap-201x300.jpg" width="201" height="300" />
<p><b>Keep Them Out</b></p>
<p>They are pretty much the first and last line of defense against birds, animals, nests, and debris. Typically surrounded with mesh of some kind, they are the absolute top of the house and exposed to the worst of everything. Birds grip them with sharp talons, animals try to dislodge them, hail pelts them with balls of ice, and rain steadily wears them down.</p>
<p>Generally lightweight, chimney caps can also be blown away by high winds, so looking for wind-resistant caps may be worthwhile, especially in certain areas. Rust used to be a problem with inferior metal caps, and it still can be, but powder finishes and stainless steels have improved them substantially. With care and a little help from nature, chimney caps can be reasonably durable and some are relatively inexpensive to replace.</p>
<p><b>Keep Them In</b></p>
<p>That does not mean you should stick one up there, and forget about it, as any number of things can happen to leave a chimney cap in unsatisfactory condition. What it does for the chimney is too important to overlook, or maybe we should say under-look, since regular attention is needed. A cap <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimney#Chimney_pots.2C_caps_and_tops" target="_blank">improves a chimney’s draft</a>, and not just the caps specifically designed for that purpose.</p>
<p>Chimney caps are also useful blocks against sparks lifted all the way out of the flue. The same mesh that prevents things from entering the chimney can stop wayward sparks from progressing beyond it. Performing a number of important functions, a chimney cap should be the highest thing you see among <i>permanent</i> features of your house.</p>
