				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>During the spring and summer, many birds are looking for a new home and a place to build their nest. Sometimes, this new home happens to be inside your chimney. For a bird, this is an ideal location. They are protected from the weather, and up high where they prefer. Unfortunately for you, this is not your ideal location. Having birds in your chimney can cause you many problems. Not only can they be a fire hazard and a mess, but they can carry parasites and fleas into your home. Here are a few tips for keeping your chimney bird free.</p>
<p>First, you have to install a chimney cap or screen. This way, the birds cant  get inside your chimney. This also keeps your chimney clear of many other problems. Now it’s time to ask for a chimney professional’s assistance to  install your cap or screen. They will ensure the quality of the installation and to make sure that nothing goes wrong. Chimney caps and screens come in many different varieties. You will want to have a chimney professional inspect your chimney to make the correct choice. You will want to choose one that is durable and safe. You will be able to get an estimate at this time for the service. Luckily, once you have a chimney cap or screen installed, you will most likely not need to replace it.</p>
<p>You can also try purchasing an ultrasonic device. This device emits a high pitch sound to keep birds away. However, if you already have a bird problem in your chimney at home, it’s time to call a professional. Ask for help from a chimney sweep. They have expert knowledge in removing different animals from your chimney without the risk of harming or hurting them. Also, they know how and where to release them upon removal. Keeping birds out of your chimney can be an easy fix with an expert at hand.</p>
