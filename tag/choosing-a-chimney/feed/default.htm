				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are two types of chimneys, and both have their benefits and limitations. These are masonry chimneys and pre-fabricated chimneys. Masonry chimney is the traditional chimney that is used by most households. Factory built chimneys are a non-masonry material that is easier to install and generally cheaper.</p>
<p>Knowing what type of chimney is best for your home would require analysis of the appliance that the chimney be connected to as well as the vending needs of these appliances. Such appliances would include furnaces, wood stoves, fireplaces, etc.</p>
<p>A factory built fireplace will also need a factory built chimney. Wood stoves, on the other hand, can be connected to either factory built or masonry chimneys. If you decide to have your own chimney, first, think about what the chimney is going to be used for. Determine what type of chimney will work best for you by knowing what appliance will be connected to it. Look at the instruction manual of factory built fireplaces or wood stoves so you can decide perfectly on your chimney type.</p>
<p>If you are installing a new appliance (or changing appliances) into your current chimney, you also need to determine if the chimney will work with your appliance. Never assume that your chimney can serve all types of appliances.</p>
<p>All types of chimneys have the function of bringing smoke out of the house and providing the fire with air. Both of these tasks are performed by the two main types of chimneys, but knowing the advantages and disadvantages of all chimneys and how they differ from each other can help you choose the best chimney for you. Households that are having a hard time deciding on the right chimney should consult a fireplace professional. Choosing the wrong chimney for your appliance can be very dangerous and may even cause fire.</p>
