				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What, did you just hear a noise that sounded like baby birds coming from your chimney? Chances are those sounds are coming from baby Chimney Swifts waiting for food. Unfortunately, you can do little about it until the birds are done nesting in your chimney. Why? Because Chimney Swifts are protected under the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Migratory_Bird_Treaty_Act_of_1918" target="_blank">Migratory Bird Treaty Act</a>.</p>
<p>If you have called a chimney sweep and they have offered to remove the birds, you should know right now that this is illegal and you should be dealing with a different chimney cleaning company. In fact, the proper response from them would be to advise you to not use the chimney and delay the cleaning until the baby birds have left their nest. At this time, the chimney can be cleaned and precautions can be put in place to ensure this does not happen again.</p>
<p>Once the birds are gone, have your chimney inspected and cleaned as soon as possible. At this time, inquire about a chimney cap being installed on the chimney. In addition to the cap, the chimney should be fitted for a protective screen that will further prevent birds, small animals, and leaves from getting into the flue of the chimney. The cap will also help prevent water and other outside elements from getting into the chimney and causing structural damage to the chimney or the chimney liner.</p>
<p>Swifts like to return to previous nesting spaces, so if the problem is not addressed, you will more than likely have the same problem next year. You should know that not taking these precautions can lead to a very dangerous situation for both you and the birds. If the nest has not been cleaned out, it may have become unstable over the course of time and the birds could fall down inside the chimney while nesting. In addition, parasites may have become embedded in the nest, further endangering the birds.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wintering in South America and migrating to eastern North America, Chimney Swifts spend most their time in flight.  They usually arrive in the U.S. in the later part of March for breeding and leave around early November.  Often referred to as flying cigars, these birds make this journey in large flocks which is how they typically travel.</p>
<p>Chimney Swifts traditionally used hollow trees to build their nests in but are now commonly being found nesting in urban areas, especially house chimneys and smoke stacks.  This is partially due to the loss of older forests to cutting and thinning.  This has made finding adequate nesting areas difficult and may be contributing to their declining numbers.</p>
<p>Flying almost constantly, Chimney Swifts eat in flight feasting on mosquitoes and other flying pests. Just like bats, Chimney Swifts are beneficial to humans eating several times their weight. Their feeding schedules are just the opposite though, as bats are headed out to feed in the evening Chimney Swifts are returning to their nests.  They even drink while flying, swooping down just above the water and dipping their beak into the water.</p>
<p>Their flight has been called agile and acrobatic yet erratic. A flock, sometimes called a swoop of swifts, can ride thermals to great heights before gliding back down towards earth. Their ability to make aerobatic moves in unison makes them a joy to watch.</p>
<p>These birds are monogamous and both parents share in the incubation of their eggs. With an average of 3-7 eggs, this incubation takes 19-21 days before hatching. The young babies are then fed by both parents for the next 30 days or until the birds are ready to fly on their own.</p>
<p>While not yet endangered their numbers have been dropping which has caused some concern. This has earned them a place on the Threatened Species list. They are also protected by state and federal laws including the Migratory Bird Act of 1916.</p>
