				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gone are the days when a chimney inspection meant only one thing, a pass or a fail. Now, inspectors carry them out to different levels of attention to detail, with a Level 1 inspection being fairly basic; a once-over of visible parts of the chimney. This standard inspection is always performed, even when higher level inspections follow. It assumes that the chimney has shown no evidence of failure and is being used as it was before, with no changes to it. A chimney sweep will confirm that there is no blockage of the chimney, and no worrying buildup of flammable creosote.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2680" title="Level 2 Inspection - Nashville TN - Ashbusters Chimney Service" alt="Level 2 Inspection - Nashville TN - Ashbusters Chimney Service" src="http://www.ashbusters.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/ashbusters-level-2-chimney-inspection-300x199.jpg" width="300" height="199" /></p>
<p>Having confirmed the structural integrity of the chimney as part of a Level 1 inspection, a change in use requires Level 2 checks. If the flue is being relined or glass doors are being installed, a <a href="http://www.csia.org/homeowner-resources/chimney_inspections.aspx" target="_blank">more detailed inspection</a> is needed. A Level 2 inspection should be considered mandatory after a chimney fire or other sudden onset problems. Further, it should attend every sale or transfer of the house as part of an overall inspection.</p>
<p>In a Level 2 inspection, there will be a thorough check of the chimney interior as well as the attic and crawlspaces of the home. The flue will be visually scanned and checked for damage as well as deposits of soot and tar. Proper sizing of the fireplace and flue will be checked along with proper chimney height.</p>
<p>While inspectors do not have to remove chase covers, they are expected to do a very thorough inspection of the chimney. They will ascertain whether the chimney system as a whole is properly constructed. They will confirm sufficient clearance between the chimney and surrounding combustible materials.</p>
<p>In short, a Level 2 chimney inspection is important to put the homeowner’s mind at ease. Along with the dryer vents, the chimney is the place most likely to house a fire and is given fuel every time smoke rises up it. It just makes sense in certain circumstances to go beyond the basic inspection.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chimneys are natural sources of drafts because they are gaping holes that emit and pull in air. Anyone who owns a wood burning appliance should understand the concept of draft. Air moving up a chimney follows the same physical principles as does water flowing in a hose. Addressing chimney draft issues enables the fireplace and chimney to operate in peak condition.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2301" title="Dealing with chimney draft problems" alt="Dealing with chimney draft problems" src="http://www.ashbusters.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/ashbusters-chimney-draft-problems-300x239.jpg" width="300" height="239" /></p>
<p>When the fireplace chimney is filled with hot air, additional air is pulled through the firebox in a process called draft. A chimney is an example of a negative pressure system because air pressure is negative. Increasing the chimney draft is similar to opening a water faucet connected to a hose. By burning a fire hotter, lighter air is created, increasing the draft in the chimney through increased pull. Increasing the chimney height will also provide more draft.</p>
<p>Given the same amount of draft, a flue that is larger will exhaust more smoke from a fireplace. However, just as a water hose may become plugged, chimney airflow may be restricted by several conditions, slowing the flow of smoke up the chimney. A closed or improperly operating damper, excessive deposits of creosote, or dirty chimney cap can create poor air flow within a chimney.</p>
<p>An improperly constructed chimney or structural damage to the area can also prevent the maximum amount of smoke from being exhausted from the fireplace. In some cases, smoke may be emitted backwards, ending up in the home. This forces occupants to breathe the contained chemicals and impurities, which is a health hazard.</p>
<p>A chimney sweep can <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/services/inspections/">inspect the chimney</a> to identify whether the proper amount of draft and air flow are occurring. If creosote has built up or something is obstructing the air flow, the sweep will remove it by cleaning the chimney. Structural issues can be addressed by chimney repair or in the most severe cases, replacement.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From Thanksgiving Day on through the winter season, there are many homeowners who face a dilemma regarding their chimneys, which are not in good shape after years of use.  If you are one of these people, it is a good idea to look for professional and dependable people that will solve this issue.  There are companies which use their skills and know-how regarding <a title="Chimney Inspection" href="../services/inspections/" target="_blank">chimney inspections</a>.  They are making their initial check to learn if the vent or chimney is doing its purpose safely and securely.  Their first inspection is on the heating shaft and the fireplace.  These professionals are scrutinizing also if there is smoke tip out, blockages or sometimes intrusion of animals, and signs of water coming in the chimney.</p>
<p>You have to be meticulous in looking for chimney companies that will apply their expertise for <strong>chimney inspections</strong> before deciding which of them you want to work on your chimney.  These professionals should be able to clean or scrub the soot from the bottom up to the top down, replacing the handle and damper and then re-inspecting the whole system.  You have to be sure that the workers will be able to pinpoint damages, any possible poor design of the chimney, and any gaps and holes. Any of these issues can cause fire to spread throughout your house. By using these checks, the chimney company should be able to identify any potential obstruction or damage to the chimney structure.</p>
<p>It is important for the chimney professionals to explain all of the issues with your chimney in detail. Make sure you understand what they are telling you so you will make the best choice for your home. If the need arises, they may need to install a chimney cap that will keep out weather, debris and animals from your chimney. Another potential solution would be a screen.</p>
<p>Look for a dependable and certified chimney company when dealing with your chimney. Schedule an appointment to get an estimate on pricing and service.</p>
