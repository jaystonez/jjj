<p>Having a chimney in your home is more than just having cozy warm nights with a rustic ambiance. It also entails a lot of responsibility and keen observational skills on your end, especially if you want to ensure your chimney’s functionality as well as your family’s safety.</p>
<p>More often than not, our team at <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/" target="_blank">Ashbusters Chimney Service</a> get approached by homeowners presenting concerns or asking certain things and issues about their chimneys. One of the most asked questions is regarding their chimney draft.</p>
<p><strong><em>So, here’s a short reference that has everything you would need to know about chimney drafts:</em></strong></p>
<h3>What is a chimney draft?</h3>
<p>The chimney draft, or simply called the draft, is the pulling action in your chimney caused by the negative pressure mechanism that’s at play inside each and every one of your chimneys. You see, your chimney produces hot air. When the heat generated inside the chimney reaches a certain level, it starts to pull air through the firebox, and thus, the draft.</p>
<h3>How will you be able to identify a draft problem?</h3>
<p>This is relatively easy to spot. All you need to watch out for are the 3 cardinal signs that are indicative of a chimney draft problem. First, you need to observe the air inside your home. If air begins to enter your home from your chimney, then that’s a sign that something is definitely wrong. Second, when you have unusual trying to start a fire or keep it burning, that’s another sign. And lastly, if you notice a smokey smell around your house even without a fire burning, then that’s definitely a warning sign.</p>
<h3>How does it affect us?</h3>
<p>Initially or in minute cases, draft problems don’t really pose that much of a threat to us. But according to the C<a href="http://www.csia.org/" target="_blank">himney Safety Institute of America</a>, in worst case scenarios it may turn your home into a risky living environment by becoming a fire and health hazard. Carbon monoxide poisoning can easily occur due to improper draft.</p>
<h3>What can we do?</h3>
<p>The best and smartest thing to do is to contact a <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/contact-us/" target="_blank">chimney expert</a> to check your chimney as soon as possible. Not only will they be able to point out damages and risks, but they would also help you in setting up preventive measure as to avoid dreadful and horrible scenarios from ever occurring.</p>
<p>Chimney draft problems are more common than you think. For all you know you have one going on in your home at this very moment. So what are you waiting for? Pick up the phone or open your computers and set an appointment as soon as you can.</p>

<div id="attachment_3195" style="width: 265px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/All-About-Carbon-Monoxide-Nashville-TN-Ashbusters-Chimney.jpg" class="highslide" onclick="return hs.expand(this)" ><img class="size-medium wp-image-3195" alt="Don't fall prey to this deadly gas.

Eliminate the risks of carbon monoxide poisoning by having regular inspections and being alert!</p></div>
<h3>What is Carbon Monoxide?</h3>
<p>Carbon Monoxide is an odorless, colorless gas that is extremely toxic. Once it enters the bloodstream, it begins to compete with the current oxygen levels. CO can be released into the air by using everyday appliances, such as generators, vehicles, and also your fireplace. If you are around one of these, make sure the area you are in is open. If the appliance has a vent, arrange where the fumes go outside. Lastly, never use something to heat your home that is not intended for that purpose, such as a gas oven, and do not leave other heating methods unattended or on overnight.</p>
<h3>How can you prevent carbon monoxide from getting in the air?</h3>
<p>Chimney draft is important when talking about carbon monoxide because if the draft cannot appropriately pull air through the home and out for the chimney, it will remain in the home. You can adjust the draft pressure by changing the heat of the fire or changing the physical structure of the chimney.</p>
<h3>Reasons draft is compromised</h3>
<p>Often times a draft’s flow can be disrupted. One of the most common and avoidable reasons is an abundance of creosote build up inside of the chimney. Creosotes are combustion particles released as firewood is burned that clump together as the make their way up the chimney. This is one of the reasons you should always make sure your chimney sweep is<a href="http://www.csia.org/homeowner-resources/how_to_hire_a_chimney_sweep.aspx" target="_blank"> Chimney Safety Institute of America</a> (CSIA) certified. CSIA has a list of set guidelines they use to ensure that you appointment is worth your time and will keep you safe. Other things that could cause draft problems include clogged dampers and dirty chimney caps.</p>
<h3>Other sources of potential trouble</h3>
<p>Other than draft problems, carbon monoxide can build up when other equipment is consuming the same clean air that is being vented within the house. If you use exhaust fans when you’re using a fuel-burning heater or stove, only run the fans for a few minutes at a time. Prolonged usage could remove too much air and waste heat. Also, do not run any power attic vents during the winter. When a fireplace or woodstove is running, open a window and turn off anything that releases warm air. You can also try replacing the air duct that connects to the fireplace so it does not steal air from your furnace.</p>
<h3>How can I protect my family?</h3>
<p>Now companies have invented CO alarms that you can install in your home to be alerted if levels in the area become dangerous. To get the best results, spread multiple alarms throughout the home, especially if there are multiple levels or an open floor plan. Some systems are built where you can connect them so that when one sounds they all go off. These alarms should be used with smoke detectors, not instead of, and should be tested periodically.</p>
<h3>What does CO poisoning feel like and how is it treated?</h3>
<p>Because of the state of carbon monoxide, people cannot tell when it begins to fill a room. This is detrimental to a person’s health because they will intake more than their body can handle before they even realize it. There are differing levels of symptoms you can have depending on how much of the gas you take in. Mild symptoms are flulike and include nausea, dizziness, headache, and fatigue, while the more severe symptoms can lead to fatality. If someone in your home has a medical condition they may react differently or more quickly, while people with heart and breathing conditions will begin to experience chest pain.</p>
<p>If you or the people around you begin to feel these symptoms, you should evacuate the area immediately, even if you cannot get to whatever is releasing the gas to turn it off. You should also seek immediate medical attention. Patients who have had minimal exposure should be able to be treated in office, but in extreme cases they may have to be admitted into a hospital to receive oxygen to normalize levels.</p>

Having a working knowledge on this can lessen your bill and ensure the safety of your whole family.</p></div>
<h3>What is it and how does it affect my chimney?</h3>
<p>We talk a lot about combustion in the chimney business, because combustion affects the <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/tag/carbon-monoxide-poisoning/" target="_blank">safety of your chimney</a> and the quality of the air inside your home. We’d like to take a minute to explain what combustion is, so you know exactly how it affects your chimney and your health. Then you’ll be able to make confident decisions about how to operate your fireplace safely, know when you need to have service performed, and why.</p>
<p>Combustion and creosote are partners. Bad combustion equals more creosote, and good combustion equals less creosote. Creosote is a bad by-product of fire, though it’s an unavoidable one. In fact, understanding a little bit about combustion is going to help you understand a whole lot more about creosote. So let’s break it down for you:</p>
<p>Combustion is the <a href="http://www.arb.ca.gov/research/indoor/wood_burning_handbook.pdf" target="_blank">process of burning</a>. Basically, it’s the process that gets us fire. Combustion needs three elements: fuel, heat, and oxygen. The right combination of these three elements oxidizes the fuel, which produces light and heat, and alakazam—ooooo, pretty fire.</p>
<h3>But what does this mean for me?</h3>
<p>In a perfect world, with perfect combustion, this process takes place at exactly the right temperature, and has exactly the right amount of oxygen and fuel. That’s what complete combustion is. This would be a fire that produces no smoke or by-products. Now, as we well know, we don’t live in a perfect world—and try as you might, you’ll never build the perfect fire—which is why you need us.</p>
<p>Combustion as we know it (which is what we call incomplete combustion) produces toxic pollutants that stick to the inside of your chimney (creosote) and affect your health.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) that can cause cancer</li>
<li>Fine particle pollution (ash) that damages lung tissue and creates respiratory problems</li>
<li>Volatile organic compounds (VOCs)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.cpsc.gov/en/Safety-Education/Safety-Education-Centers/Carbon-Monoxide-Information-Center/Carbon-Monoxide-Questions-and-Answers-/" target="_blank">Carbon monoxide</a>, formaldehyde, nitrogen oxides</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s a no-brainer that we all want to avoid these pollutants, so it’s important to know how to operate your fireplace in a way that increases combustion as much as possible to reduce the nasty side effects of incomplete combustion. We’ve got some great info on how to build a good fire, <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/tag/firewood/" target="_blank">how to choose the right wood</a>, and <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/get-chimney-creosote-free/" target="_blank">how to get rid of creosote</a>.</p>
<p>The best way to stay ahead of incomplete combustion is by keeping up with routine chimney maintenance. Have your chimney inspected and cleaned annually. So <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/contact-us/" target="_blank">give us a call</a> when it’s that time of year—when it comes to your chimney, we do it all.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Regardless of where it is, space you frequently occupy needs to offer a way out that is <a href="http://www.usfa.fema.gov/downloads/pyfff/escapes.html" target="_blank">obvious in emergency situations</a>. That goes for grocery stores, banks, workplaces, classrooms, and fitness centers. Most of all, it goes for the home where you live. Do you really want to work things out when the house is filling with smoke and the alarms are going off?</p>
<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2827" title="Emergency Escape Plan - Nashville TN - Ashbusters Chimney Service" alt="Emergency Escape Plan - Nashville TN - Ashbusters Chimney Service" src="http://www.ashbusters.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/ashbusters-emergency-escape-plan-300x199.jpg" width="300" height="199" />
<p><b>The Elementary Three Rs: Review, Revise, Rehearse</b></p>
<p>The unwanted wake-up call is not the time to be mentally recalling what you are supposed to do; that recall needs to be automatic. That only happens with repetition, so any escape plan has to be practiced again and again. If it holds the keys to your family’s escape, it needs to be taken out, carefully reconsidered, and rehearsed, time and time again.</p>
<p>At a bare minimum, it should be done every time your chimney and vents are professionally cleaned, so it is on the calendar and to do list at the same time. It is not enough to prepare an escape plan, discuss it with the family, and put it in a drawer.</p>
<p><b>Where There’s Not Smoke…</b></p>
<p>Your escape plan should extend to smokeless alarms, the ones that seem to wake you for no reason. Let&#8217;s say they woke everyone up, and the plan has kicked in without effort, but there is nothing seemingly going on… nothing you can see. Which is very different than nothing, and contains something that kills way too many people every year &#8211; carbon monoxide.</p>
<p>Whether it is carbon monoxide poisoning or fire from which you are protecting your family, always have an escape plan. What you cannot see is as deadly as what you can, so get everyone out of the house until an emergency professional can determine what is going on. Doing that means having an escape plan that reflects current conditions in your home, and one that stays current for your life with repeated practice. If you need some ideas about where to start, <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/contact-us/">give us a call</a>, and we&#8217;d be glad to help you create a plan of escape in an emergency for your household.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Carbon Monoxide (CO) is a odorless, colorless gas that is produced by burning fuel. It is slightly lighter than air, which causes it to rise to the top of the space it occupies. It is very toxic for both humans and animals, and should be avoided in high concentrations. Homes with fireplaces are especially prone to accidental CO poisoning, if not properly vented. For this reason, you need to have a regular chimney cleaning and inspection to make sure you don&#8217;t have a dangerous situation on your hands.</p>
<p>Here are some common facts regarding CO and CO poisoning:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hundreds of people are killed each year by accidental CO exposure.</li>
<li>Once CO is absorbed into the bloodstream, it blocks oxygen from getting to vital organs.</li>
<li>CO is known as the &#8220;silent killer&#8221; because it is so difficult to detect unless you have a CO monitor.</li>
<li>CO poisoning causes sleepiness, fatigue, and mental confusion, making it much harder to remove yourself from the contaminated area.</li>
</ul>
<p>A couple of the ways that chimneys can be big emitters of CO is if they are dirty or obstructed. A dirty chimney is covered in creosote, which is highly flammable. Creosote can catch on fire, causing damage to the chimney and home. An obstructed chimney will keep the smoke from exiting the chimney properly, and can even send the smoke back into the house. Obstructions can come from birds nests, insect or animal nests, and natural debris like leaves or branches. Chimney caps can help avoid these types of obstructions.</p>
<p>CO poisoning can come from a variety of other places, like grills, furnaces, and even your car. Never grill indoors, or underneath a covering. Make sure your furnace is working properly, and is not putting out any dangerous carbon monoxide. When starting your car in a garage, make sure the door is open. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission has a very helpful list of <a href="http://www.cpsc.gov/cpscpub/pubs/466.html" target="_blank">carbon monoxide facts</a> that just may help save your life.</p>
