				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the owner of a home that has a built-in fireplace and working chimney, it’s important that you stay diligent in inspecting the integrity of these working appliances.</p>
<p>As you use your fireplace and chimney throughout the winter, make it a point to do a visual scan of your chimney, for any cracks or other potential problems. If you spot a crack, don’t panic. Sometimes cracks are merely cosmetic blemishes. However, it’s important to contact your <a title="Your Local Certified Chimney Inspector" href="http://www.ashbusters.net/services/inspections/">local chimney inspector</a> to make sure there isn’t a more serious problem. By visually inspecting your chimney regularly, you can prevent larger damages before they become major problems. Plus, you can keep your fireplace and chimney in top working condition, so they keep your family warm all winter long.</p>
<p>Your <a title="Chimney Sweeping" href="http://www.ashbusters.net/services/sweeping/">professionally trained chimney sweep</a> will be able to rule out any serious damages, and can recommend the necessary repairs. However, if you spot a crack, don’t delay in contacting a chimney inspection service. The more diligent you are in spotting cracks in your chimney, the more likely it is that you will prevent dangerous problems and costly repairs.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a title="More Information on Creosote" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creosote">Creosote build-up</a> is a natural occurrence in chimneys that are used regularly. Creosote is highly combustible, thus it is important to understand what causes it, and what can be done to prevent its build-up.</p>
<p>Creosote build-up occurs when wood and other materials are burned at a low temperature. When coal and wood is not burned down completely, creosote is emitted and can cling to your chimneys. The more creosote build-up that occurs (sometimes up to several inches in your chimney) the less likely it is that the wood in your fireplace will burn at a hotter temperature, making more creosote. Because of this, your chimney must be professionally cleaned regularly. You can also reduce the occurrence of creosote build-up by making sure your fires are burning very hot, by only burning wood that has been seasoned, and by not burning coniferous wood such as pine and spruce. Removing creosote deposits is the best way to prevent a fire hazard in your chimney, and the best way to keep your fireplace burning hot and efficiently all winter long.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s a messy job, but someone has to do it. Chimney sweeps have been doing the hard work of <a title="Ashbusters Chimney Services" href="http://www.ashbusters.net/services/">cleaning and inspecting chimneys</a> for years. The job is often considered dirty and undesirable, but it’s a respected and valued position for anyone that owns a home with a chimney and/or fireplace.</p>
<p>During the Industrial Revolution, many children were employed as chimney sweeps. Because they are smaller, they could fit into the chimney with ease. With advances in modern technology, and new equipment that improves the chimney sweeping techniques used, people the size of children are no longer needed as chimney sweeps. Instead, this valuable profession is reserved for the highly trained and responsible. <a title="Chimney Sweeping and Cleaning" href="http://www.ashbusters.net/services/sweeping/">Chimney sweeps</a> are highly trained in chimney repair and diagnostics. After all, they must be able to detect chimney repairs before they become major problems in your home. Vacuums, high–tech equipment, and even cameras are used to inspect every inch of a homeowner’s chimney to make sure it is clean and in proper (and safe) working order. The Chimney Safety Institute of America and the National Chimney Sweeps Guild are both respected organizations that aid in the education and training of chimney sweeps today.</p>
<p>It’s smart to not trust the inspection, cleaning, and care of your chimney to just anyone. Utilize a professional company that is highly skilled and professionally trained to assess and address all possible problems in your chimney. Keep your chimney in safe, working condition year after year with a regular chimney inspection from <a title="Ashbusters.net" href="http://www.ashbusters.net/">Ashbusters</a>, your professional chimney sweep company.</p>
