				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever thought of the safety of your fireplace? There are many incidents which could be very dangerous for you and your family if the fireplace is not safe. One of which is carbon monoxide poisoning. Carbon monoxide poisoning claims an average of 3,000 to 4,000 lives each year, and the reason behind it is the poor maintenance of the fireplace. This is the result of incomplete burning in the fireplace. A low level of poisoning will cause flu-like symptoms to someone who is exposed to carbon monoxide. This would make the person think that they are just having the regular flu. However, advanced poisoning would progress to vomiting and headache, which would eventually lead to death. This is because the body sometimes prefers carbon monoxide over oxygen when the two are present in the atmosphere. That is why it is very important to know the safety status of your fireplace.</p>
<p>Chimney fires are a major threat to your property. This is caused by creosote buildup in the chimney. Creosote is a gummy, tar-like substance which can be found in the flue. This substance can catch fire and the first stage of the fire cannot be noticed immediately. However, when creosote catches fire, it has a sound which would be like a jet on a low altitude. The most common accident which involves fireplaces is chimney failure. Due to wear and tear the bolts and bricks may eventually wither and break. First signs of this are cracks that you may find in some of the visible masonry. However, another reason for the wear and tear of the chimney is poor maintenance. That is why it is highly advised to have your <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/services/inspections/">chimney maintained by experts</a> who know all about what to do. Have your chimney checked to answer the question: is your fireplace safe?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One big thing for homeowners to think about is which type of fireplace do they want. Now this decision can come as they are shopping for a new home, but it can also come when they are thinking about a home remodeling project. It is important to remember that adding a fireplace does not necessarily mean having to have major structural changes to your home. Of course, structural changes are a possibility. It all depends on the choices you make.</p>
<p>One very popular form of fireplace installation is a direct vent gas fireplace. They provide a very efficient way of heating the home, and help homeowners avoid the mess of a traditional wood fireplace. These are powered by either propane or natural gas. You can also get ventless fireplaces that use natural gas or propane, but we do not recommend them. The chance of Carbon Monoxide poisoning is too great.</p>
<p>Electric fireplaces and Pellet stoves are additional types of fireplace appliances. Electric fireplaces are useful for some people, but they have to keep in mind that this type of fireplace can cost you more than a gas alternative. Plus, if you ever experience a power outage, the fireplace is not going to work. Pellet stoves can be a useful alternative to having an insert. Plus, they are probably cheaper in regards to home modifications.</p>
<p>Finally, there is always the good old wood stove and chimney choice. While you may not want to spend the money to add one to an existing home, most new home constructions give you the choice of what you want to do. Many will even let you choose between gas and wood burning. Whatever type of fireplace or stove you are thinking about, make sure you research the various safety precautions that go along with that choice. You want to make sure you are prepared to do whatever is safest for you and your family.</p>
