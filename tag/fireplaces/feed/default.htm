				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/catalog/fireplaces-and-stoves/">Installing a fireplace</a> in your home makes your place cozy, warm and intimate. It also increases the value of your home. Fireplaces are a good accent to your house besides the fact that they are important too. Fireplaces are ideal for relaxation and for spending time with family. Choosing where to place your fireplace at home can be one of the most stressful decisions that you may encounter when beautifying your home.</p>
<p>The first thing that you need to consider in choosing the area for your fireplace is to know how you want your fireplace to contribute to the overall look of your house. Consider the area, including its parameters and layout, to see if the fireplace will fit in there. Measure the space to get an idea of how big (or small) your fireplace will be. This will also help you decide on what style or design will fit in your chosen location. Make sure it looks good with the other furnishings that are in your living room.</p>
<p>Another thing to consider is the type of fireplace that you want for your home. It may be a wood or gas burning fireplace. A gas burning fireplace is better if you will be starting from scratch. This keeps you from extensive chimney building. If you have a wood hearth installed already, you may want to convert it to a gas fireplace. Others may decide on wood fireplaces because of the thrill of cutting and burning wood in the fireplace, and to get a more traditional look. Fireplaces also come with different accessories that you will need to have in your house. Fireplace screens, mantles, and wood racks should have a place in your living room as well. Materials for fireplaces vary from wood, copper, iron, bricks and marble. Choose the one that will complement the other furniture and style in your living room. This will help you fully appreciate the beauty of your fireplace.</p>
