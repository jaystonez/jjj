				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pardon the cheesy, grammatically incorrect title/&#8217;80&#8242;s catchphrase, but who <em>are </em>you going to call when your chimney is having problems? Better yet, who will you call when your chimney is not having problems? After all chimneys need maintenance and care just like your automobile. You and your family&#8217;s safety depends on <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/services/sweeping/">performing regular maintenance on your chimney</a>. Various issues, like creosote buildup, can be addressed by regular maintenance by a chimney professional.</p>
<p>Besides checking on your chimney, who are you going to call when you are concerned about your dryer vent? If you are a regular reader of this blog, you will know how flammable lint is. In fact, the Boy Scouts of America have it in their handbook as a good tool for starting a campfire. With this in mind, you should <a href="http://www.ashbusters.net/services/dryer-vent-cleaning/">have your dryer vent cleaned on a regular basis</a>. Not only will it keep a fire from originating in your dryer vents, but it will save you money in two big ways. First, it will keep the dryer from working harder than it has to, thus keeping the wear and tear to a minimum. Second, your clothes will last a lot longer because they don&#8217;t have to stay in the dryer so long to get dry.</p>
<p>So, when we ask, &#8220;who you gonna call?&#8221;, I hope you will say Ashbusters. We specialize in performing the ugly, dirty maintenance tasks that protect your family, and help you sleep soundly at night. Our professional chimney sweeps are always CSIA certified to ensure the maximum level of competence when working on a chimney. Our dryer vent cleaners will always use the latest technology to keep your dryer vent completely clean and free from lint. This will greatly minimize the threat of fire from your dryer vent. Let us help you with your chimney and dryer vent today.</p>
