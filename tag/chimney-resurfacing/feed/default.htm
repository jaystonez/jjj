				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Being exposed to weather elements and the high temperatures of a fire makes the chimney susceptible to damage. A chimney may look great on the outside but its interior may be another story. If a chimney with a clay flue liner becomes damaged, it is typically rebuilt or relined with stainless steel material. However, there is a much less expensive option called HeatShield.<br />
<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2295" title="HeatShield Chimney Liner Repair" alt="HeatShield Chimney Liner Repair" src="http://www.ashbusters.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/ashbusters-heatshield-logo-300x93.jpg" width="300" height="93" /><br />
This <a href="http://cecurechimney.com/" target="_blank">chimney repair-resurfacing system</a> can restore a clay chimney flue liner at a reasonable price for you. It eliminates draft issues and hazards created by cracks, spalling, and gaps in a masonry chimney. Small defects like these can lead to huge problems if they are not addressed in a timely manner. These big problems carry big price tags and can endanger the health and safety of home occupants.</p>
<p>HeatShield Cerfractory technology has been tested repeatedly and is proven to withstand corrosive flue gases, moisture, and temperatures that exceed 2,900 degrees Fahrenheit. This sealant material restores the integrity of the flue, enabling optimal operation. Depending on the issue, either a sleeve relining system or a repair system will be recommended to restore the chimney to its original efficiency and safety levels.</p>
<p>When mortar is missing from between flue tiles, a system is used to perform joint repair. It the flue has other minor defects like a spalled or cracked flue that is otherwise sound, resurfacing is typically recommended. Resurfacing applies a special coating material over the entire flue. Repairs are verified with camera technology to ensure that they meet standards.</p>
<p>HeatShield was developed in Europe and has been in use for more than 20 years. The hybrid ceramic-refractory coating is proven effective through lab testing and daily use. If a chimney sweep notices defects in the clay flue liner and recommends a HeatShield system, take this recommendation seriously and review the options.</p>
