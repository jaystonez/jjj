		<description><![CDATA[I called for an estimate on our chimney because sometimes we get a small amount of water on our heath if there is a strong wind with rain. They were on time and very courteous. Within 15 mins they inspected the problem showed me pictures,explained the issue and gave me a written quote!  No pressure, no upselling...Just factual and professional.  We are looking over our budget feel confident that they will do a great job for us.]]></description>
