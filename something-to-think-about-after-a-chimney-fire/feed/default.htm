		<description><![CDATA[your card you left said click on &quot;review&quot; but i dont see that on your website.  i will say this that i called early before a big rain and my chimney was leaking and had for some time and your guys (Matt &amp; Clyde) (I nick named them Starsky &amp; Hutch) were out within a few hours, an hour early than anticipated which was OK because I said I was home all day, came over, played with my dogs, were very professional and courteous, clean and did the job, they were very knowledgeable in what they were talking about and I felt very comfortible dealing with them.

I will recommend them to all of my friends and work collegues.

Thank you very much.
